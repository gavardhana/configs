2014-03-02 17:39:57	Fyr	even I don't want to be in Siberia in '90s.
2014-03-02 17:40:26	Ge	Haha, fair enough.  Yeah, I hear Siberia is a tad chilli time-to-time.
2014-03-02 17:40:46	Ge	Yeah, early, 1990s there was a lot of political instability, right?
2014-03-02 17:40:56	Fyr	yep
2014-03-02 17:47:36	Fyr	the Crimea will be the prefect complement to the Olympics' trophies.
2014-03-02 18:11:59	JohnTheSavage101	Fyr: why do you, a russian citizen, hate Ukraine?
2014-03-02 18:12:43	Fyr	I have many reasons.
2014-03-02 18:12:58	Fyr	should I list them here?
2014-03-02 18:13:40	JohnTheSavage101	Fyr: if you could, yes
2014-03-02 18:15:24	Fyr	1) Territory
2014-03-02 18:15:28	Fyr	2) Policy
2014-03-02 18:15:42	Fyr	1) the peninsula is ours.
2014-03-02 18:16:04	Fyr	2) I hate the fascist party that overthrown Yanukovich.
2014-03-02 18:16:43	JohnTheSavage101	Fyr: wanting the peninsula is one thing, but saying that you want Ukrainian citizens to be harmed is one thing
2014-03-02 18:17:12	Fyr	I'm all for the peaceful way.
2014-03-02 18:17:53	JohnTheSavage101	Fyr: some would say that Russia's way of expanding its teritory would be a fascist one
2014-03-02 18:18:20	Fyr	Russians and Tartars live in the Crimea.
2014-03-02 18:18:34	Fyr	Ukranians are the minorities there.
2014-03-02 18:19:14	Fyr	the population of the peninsula have been suppressing for a long time.
2014-03-02 18:20:01	Fyr	the official Kiev just ignored the problems that occured to happen to it.
2014-03-02 18:20:04	JohnTheSavage101	Fyr: that sounds like my own country's propaganda of how some parts of Ukraine (and of other neighbours) are rightfully and historically ours
2014-03-02 18:20:24	Fyr	UK's?
2014-03-02 18:20:46	JohnTheSavage101	Fyr: yes, Ukraine's. I'm Romanian.
2014-03-02 18:21:45	Fyr	are you saying that the United Kingdom lays a claim to the territory of Ukraine?
2014-03-02 18:21:53	Fyr	how is it possible?
2014-03-02 18:22:01	JohnTheSavage101	Fyr: no, not the United Kingdom

2014-03-02 18:22:25	Fyr	sorry.
2014-03-02 18:22:34	Ge	Fyr: No, he said Romania claims part of Ukraine.
2014-03-02 18:22:35	Fyr	what country are you from?
2014-03-02 18:22:40	JohnTheSavage101	Fyr: my country, Romania, has a claim on territories that Ukraine holds
2014-03-02 18:23:26	Ge	Fyr: Australia does not have any disputed territorial claims.  There are some iffy Australia territorial claims in Antarctica that we inherited from the United Kingdom though.
2014-03-02 18:23:27	JohnTheSavage101	Fyr: there was even an article online about how Romania should seize this opportunity to get it back
2014-03-02 18:23:50	Fyr	I can't find the claims.
2014-03-02 18:24:02	Fyr	sorry, I know nothing about the topic.
2014-03-02 18:24:03	Ge	Fyr: There is no overlap between Australia claims for territory in Antarctica and any other country's claims though.

2014-03-02 18:25:39	Fyr	ok, bring in the troops there.
2014-03-02 18:25:46	Ge	Fyr: Do you think this affects the Eurasian Union project?
2014-03-02 18:26:24	Ge	...is it related even?  It comes at a bad time.  The two projects make Putin's foreign policy look expansionist.
2014-03-02 18:26:43	JohnTheSavage101	Fyr: this isn't a threat. As far as I know, they're in Ukraine's jurisdiction and they can do whatever they want with them.
2014-03-02 18:26:52	Fyr	Ge, do you really want to know my opinion?
2014-03-02 18:27:03	Ge	Fyr: Yup, I do.
2014-03-02 18:27:08	Fyr	why do you wanna know my opinion about EU?
2014-03-02 18:27:45	Ge	Fyr: I thought you meant the Eurasian Union that Russia is sponsoring.
2014-03-02 18:28:12	Fyr	No.
2014-03-02 18:28:37	Fyr	nobody really believed that Ukraine joined the EU.
2014-03-02 18:28:45	JohnTheSavage101	Fyr: what I'm trying to say is that it isn't the first time a country starts a war on the grounds of protecting its people in its neighbours' borders
2014-03-02 18:28:51	Ge	The European Union has some fiscal problem evidently.  It probably has been effective preventing more war in continental Europe though.  It developed out of a project "the European Steel Community" or something like that.
2014-03-02 18:30:14	Ge	JohnTheSavage101: Most advanced economies nowadays could not do that either because of multiculturalism.  Races are not sovereign.  World War II taught us the consequences of thinking that.
2014-03-02 18:30:33	Fyr	Ge, good.
2014-03-02 18:30:55	Fyr	the fascist party has overthrown Yanukovich.
2014-03-02 18:31:05	Fyr	any ideas how to solve it?
2014-03-02 18:31:51	Ge	Fyr: Oh... what is the political party's name?
2014-03-02 18:32:00	Ge	Fyr: I have not read much about it to be honest.
2014-03-02 18:32:50	JohnTheSavage101	Fyr: might sound harsh, but risking a war and economical sanctions for the sake of grabbing a territory and "rescueing" some thousands of people isn't worth it
2014-03-02 18:34:01	Ge	JohnTheSavage101: Is this credible: http://www.globalresearch.ca/ukraine-neo-nazi-party-threatens-russia-with-nuclear-weapons-well-regain-our-nuclear-status/5371524 ?
2014-03-02 18:34:02	@Russia	Title: Ukraine Neo-Nazi Party Threatens Russia with Nukes: “We’ll Regain our Nuclear Status in 6 Months” | Global Research
2014-03-02 18:34:10	JohnTheSavage101	Ge: wtf
2014-03-02 18:34:22	Ge	JohnTheSavage101: I do not know...
2014-03-02 18:34:35	Ge	JohnTheSavage101: It just came up in Google... is the Ukrainian government actually okay?
2014-03-02 18:35:06	Fyr	that is the reason of this invasion shit.
2014-03-02 18:35:28	JohnTheSavage101	Ge: meh, it might be just some idiot's declaration. Every country has some of those.
2014-03-02 18:35:33	Fyr	they dissolved the government and make another one.
2014-03-02 18:35:42	JohnTheSavage101	Ge: no-one in their right mind would use those kinds of threats
2014-03-02 18:35:56	Fyr	the law that they passed first was to forbid the other languages in Ukrane.
2014-03-02 18:37:20	Ge	Fyr: Is there a citation for that, it sounds interesting.
2014-03-02 18:37:25	Fyr	that's why the Crimea claimed that it no longer takes dictation of Kiev.
2014-03-02 18:37:33	Fyr	Ge, Google it.
2014-03-02 18:37:45	Ge	JohnTheSavage101: Well, it sounds like the Ukrainian government has questionable domestic policy.
2014-03-02 18:39:16	JohnTheSavage101	Ge: indeed
2014-03-02 18:39:53	JohnTheSavage101	Oh, GlobalResearch got that article from RussiaToday.
2014-03-02 18:40:43	Ge	JohnTheSavage101: So, it is credible?
2014-03-02 18:41:12	nastolko	yes it is
2014-03-02 18:41:56	JohnTheSavage101	Ge: government funding. I wouldn't belive it, but I wouldn't dismiss it either.
2014-03-02 18:48:11	Ge	Fyr: It seems a Ukraine political party cancelled a law allowing regions to officially recognise languages that not the Ukrainian language as secondary languages.
2014-03-02 18:48:36	Ge	Fyr: I agree that is not on, but it is not really outlawing the language.
2014-03-02 18:48:42	Fyr	that's why Putin didn't invade the Crimea.
2014-03-02 18:48:58	Fyr	but he is about to do that.
2014-03-02 18:49:52	Fyr	if the party makes wrong steps, Putin will perform annexation.
2014-03-02 18:52:25	Ge	Fyr: It is tricky I guess.  Electoral democracy has a weakness.  Kant called it the "tyranny of the majority".  Even if most Ukrainians support whatever, there is still a democratic duty to protect minority rights.  Having official languages is probably not helpful.  Many countries do not officially recognise any languages.
2014-03-02 18:54:46	Fyr	Ge, it doesn't matter. the treasury is empty, the Ukraine's economy is stale. some radicals rule the government.
2014-03-02 18:55:25	Fyr	it would be cool if the East and South join the Russian Federation.
2014-03-02 18:55:46	JohnTheSavage101	Fyr: what about West and North? :P
2014-03-02 18:55:59	Fyr	they can live their lives.
2014-03-02 18:56:13	Fyr	join the EU some day.
2014-03-02 18:56:35	Fyr	pass some pro-gay laws.
2014-03-02 18:57:44	Fyr	it will make happy Obama, so he will grant some money for them.
2014-03-02 18:58:13	Ge	Fyr: LOL, gay marriage.  Do many people in Russia support that?
2014-03-02 18:58:25	JohnTheSavage101	Fyr: come on, why do you even CARE about gay marriage?
2014-03-02 18:58:26	Fyr	what do you think?
2014-03-02 18:58:47	Fyr	Ge, around 5 people in whole Russia.
2014-03-02 18:59:09	JohnTheSavage101	Fyr: I mean, they're not loved in Romania either, but at least we don't pass laws against them
2014-03-02 18:59:16	Ge	There have been some attempt to introduce it here, but it has failed to pass parliament at the federal level and territorial government attempts have been stuck down by the High Court.
2014-03-02 18:59:27	Ge	Fyr: Yar, not many then.
2014-03-02 18:59:31	Fyr	JohnTheSavage101, neither do we.
2014-03-02 18:59:35	Ge	I guess more than five people support it here.
2014-03-02 18:59:40	Ge	More than 12 even.
2014-03-02 19:02:05	Ge	Fyr: Only one political party supports homosexual marriage here... the Greens.
2014-03-02 19:02:21	Fyr	"here" is where?
2014-03-02 19:02:22	Ge	Fyr: The Australian Labor Party's left faction allows a free vote too.
2014-03-02 19:02:35	JohnTheSavage101	Ge: honestly, homosexuals should just abandon the whole idea of getting support from the state. It's causing them more harm than good.
2014-03-02 19:02:38	Ge	The centre-right Liberal Party outright does not support it.
2014-03-02 19:02:41	Ge	Fyr: Australia.
2014-03-02 19:03:41	Fyr	ok, let's forget about homos.
2014-03-02 19:04:48	Ge	JohnTheSavage101: I just do not think the issue is very important.  I think it will upset lots of Catholics, Protestants, Muslims etc too, so I cannot see how it would benefit more people than not.
2014-03-02 19:05:02	Fyr	ok, one more sentence..
2014-03-02 19:05:32	Ge	JohnTheSavage101: It would probably radicalise some groups too and make people more violent against those ceremonies, just not very helpful.
2014-03-02 19:05:35	Ge	Fyr: LOL.
2014-03-02 19:05:43	JohnTheSavage101	Ge: it's a way of distracting the attention from more serious issues
2014-03-02 19:06:12	JohnTheSavage101	Ge: a device invented by the North Americans: the importance of homosexual marriages in law
2014-03-02 19:06:48	Fyr	Ukranian faggots oil their asses with lard instead of vaseline.
2014-03-02 19:07:08	JohnTheSavage101	Fyr: come on, don't be like that
2014-03-02 19:07:54	Ge	JohnTheSavage101: Yeah, they are the most extreme both ways.
2014-03-02 19:08:07	Ge	JohnTheSavage101: Some state legalise it I think... at least at common law.
2014-03-02 19:08:23	Ge	Then, some states outright ban it and deny them different legal benefits.
2014-03-02 19:08:27	Ge	The US is weird.
2014-03-02 19:11:15	JohnTheSavage101	Fyr: come on, you, russians, used to be one of the few people on Earth that had state-sponsored atheism, but now you're all becoming religious zealots?
2014-03-02 19:11:37	Fyr	religious?
2014-03-02 19:11:45	Fyr	what am I missing?
2014-03-02 19:12:10	Ge	JohnTheSavage101: The Communist Party of the Soviet Union was atheist but it was not culturally liberal.
2014-03-02 19:12:22	Ge	JohnTheSavage101: It mostly supported traditional gender roles etc.
2014-03-02 19:18:07	Fyr	JohnTheSavage101, nobody likes homos.
2014-03-02 19:18:40	Fyr	the gay marriage is only a populist slogan of politicians.
2014-03-02 19:19:31	JohnTheSavage101	Ge: gotta admit that I didn't do my research on this one. It appears that the rest of Europe is way more atheistic than my country. I just assumed that the rest of post-communist countries were like mine. o_O
2014-03-02 19:21:51	Ge	JohnTheSavage101: Yeah, religion is weak even in countries with state sponsored churches still such as England, Denmark, Sweden before 2002 or whatever and wherever else.
2014-03-02 19:22:04	Ge	US is very religious still.
2014-03-02 19:22:08	Ge	Australia... not really.
2014-03-02 19:23:28	JohnTheSavage101	Ge: you know, emmigrating to Australia sounds like a good idea. How would I fare there? Would I get my head busted by far right parties? :D
2014-03-02 19:24:41	Ge	JohnTheSavage101: Politics... hmm... there is two main parties... the Labor Party and the Liberal Party.  The Labor Party is socialist... you know unions, welfare etc, and the Liberal Party is free-market.
2014-03-02 19:25:02	JohnTheSavage101	Ge: you know, "you romanian bastard! Flying all the way from Europe to come here and steal my fellow australians' jobs!"
2014-03-02 19:25:14	Ge	They both support "multiculturalism".  Very right-wing parties have no significant following.
2014-03-02 19:25:31	Ge	LOL, probably, would not happen.
2014-03-02 19:25:47	Ge	Some people dislike Asians for some reason.
2014-03-02 19:26:09	Fyr	Ge, are Chinese invading Australia?
2014-03-02 19:26:16	Ge	Not like hate them... just say they are bad drivers, impolite etc.
2014-03-02 19:26:23	Fyr	the Russian scientists told me so.
2014-03-02 19:26:39	Fyr	(that emmigrated to Australia)
2014-03-02 19:26:40	Ge	Fyr: I would not say invading, but China is the largest source of immigration, sure.
2014-03-02 19:27:04	Fyr	yes, thay are everywhere.
2014-03-02 19:27:54	Fyr	I have been to Thailand. when the very first time I got out the plane, I thought that I'm in China.
2014-03-02 19:29:11	Ge	They like to emigrate because of better economic opportunities and less rules elsewhere.
2014-03-02 19:29:25	Ge	The Communist Party still rules China.
2014-03-02 20:02:15	Fyr	JohnTheSavage101, "Romania" contains "Roma" that means Rome. what do you have from Roman Empire?
2014-03-02 20:04:32	JohnTheSavage101	Fyr: besides the name and a few ruins? Almost nothing.
2014-03-02 20:04:33	Fyr	except the name.
2014-03-02 20:05:58	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, only gays like gay marriage
2014-03-02 20:06:04	JohnTheSavage101	Fyr: think that the name is just an artifact of history
2014-03-02 20:08:09	JohnTheSavage101	Fyr: apart from a few centuries of roman administration in our lands 1900 years ago, I don't think we have much in common with the italians
2014-03-02 20:08:34	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, I cannot speak for everyone, but for example, as for me, what gays are doing looks disgusting for me and opposes the moral. The only explanation that I have about this abomination is not treated as a disease (potentially genetic disorder, but still) is presence of too many faggots in the government
2014-03-02 20:09:24	Lokomotiv	Fyr, слушай, а почему бы не всю Украину (раз уж пошла такая тема)? :)

2014-03-02 20:11:50	JohnTheSavage101	Fyr: we used to use the cyrillic alphabet more often than the latin one

2014-03-02 20:13:55	Lokomotiv	Fyr, ты знаешь, меня это не особо радует
2014-03-02 20:14:07	<--	govardhan_ (~fenriz@178.234.74.207) has left ##russia
2014-03-02 20:14:34	Fyr	аннексируем Крым и начнём скупать ихние облигации.
2014-03-02 20:14:41	Fyr	всё вернётся на свои круги.
2014-03-02 20:14:50	Lokomotiv	Мои в Черкассах
2014-03-02 20:15:03	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: how is it immoral? It's not affecting you in any way.
2014-03-02 20:15:39	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, well, pedophiles do not affect me in any way either, but I hate them as well and consider what they are doing immoral
2014-03-02 20:15:53	Lokomotiv	Same goes with zoolovers, swingers, necrophiles, etc
2014-03-02 20:16:19	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: it's not the same thing as zoophiles, necrophiles and pedophiles
2014-03-02 20:16:26	Lokomotiv	Oh really?
2014-03-02 20:16:39	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: it's between consenting adults
2014-03-02 20:16:40	Lokomotiv	How is it different?
2014-03-02 20:16:47	Lokomotiv	Oh, c'mon man
2014-03-02 20:16:57	Lokomotiv	Who told you that there should be only two adults?
2014-03-02 20:17:07	Lokomotiv	Same stupid old moral?
2014-03-02 20:17:34	Lokomotiv	Next step - who told you about the age of consent - why cannot it be lower than what it is? (Here we go pedophiles)
2014-03-02 20:17:55	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: it's definitely not the same thing
2014-03-02 20:18:10	Lokomotiv	Next step - why can't sexual education of children start earlier (again another victory for pedophiles)
2014-03-02 20:18:28	Lokomotiv	And now - who told you that both adults should be human (zoophiles)?
2014-03-02 20:18:42	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, tell me what is wrong in what I just told you?
2014-03-02 20:19:29	Lokomotiv	If you accept homosexuality - there are no more stops for other perverts
2014-03-02 20:19:39	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: if history would've gone the way you describe it, women wouldn't be able to vote today
2014-03-02 20:20:18	Lokomotiv	Give me a break, social rights of women, blacks, etc have nothing to do with refusing to treat diseases
2014-03-02 20:21:06	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: and make someone extremely unhappy while "treating" them?
2014-03-02 20:21:31	Lokomotiv	the good of the many outweigh the good of the few
2014-03-02 20:21:55	Lokomotiv	A child molester has his/her perverted feeling of happiness
2014-03-02 20:21:59	Lokomotiv	We ignore it - right?
2014-03-02 20:22:33	Lokomotiv	He/she is perfectly unhappy, when he/she is sent to jail - we ignore it again, right?
2014-03-02 20:23:47	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: homosexuality isn't a real problem. Go treat drug addictions and alchoholism, not this.
2014-03-02 20:24:31	Lokomotiv	Alcoholism, drug addiction and even such abominations as homosexuality - all of them are real problems
2014-03-02 20:24:58	Lokomotiv	And naming only two of them a problem does not mean that the third one is not a problem either
2014-03-02 20:25:57	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: I've never heard of a homosexual go nuts with rage when walking down the street. Druggies and alchoholics, do, though.
2014-03-02 20:27:06	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, well, if you come home and see your son fucking a dog - that's a problem, right?
2014-03-02 20:27:49	Fyr	xD
2014-03-02 20:32:58	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: afaik, zoophilia isn't legal anywhere
2014-03-02 20:33:13	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: of course I'd be pretty pissed
2014-03-02 20:33:25	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, a bunch of southern states does not have a law against zoophilia
2014-03-02 20:33:39	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: if he was having a homosexual relationship, I wouldn't really like it, but I'd accept it
2014-03-02 20:33:58	Lokomotiv	And how is that different?
2014-03-02 20:34:09	Lokomotiv	In both cases it will be two consenting adults
2014-03-02 20:34:11	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: in the end, what makes a man is not his sexual orientation, but how he acts in the world
2014-03-02 20:35:02	Lokomotiv	Unfortunately (even if you do not want to accept it) straight orientation is also what makes a man
2014-03-02 20:36:56	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: really? I think that there are way more asshole men that are straight than there are asshole men that are homosexual
2014-03-02 20:37:13	Lokomotiv	Oh yeah, because homosexuals are a minority
2014-03-02 20:37:25	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: are the straight men who beat their wives secretely homosexual?
2014-03-02 20:37:50	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, do not mix domestic violence with homosexuality
2014-03-02 20:38:00	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: I honestly don't know a single homosexual man or someone who knows someone that's a homosexual
2014-03-02 20:38:04	Lokomotiv	It is present in both straight and homosexual relationship
2014-03-02 20:38:23	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, well, let's put it this way
2014-03-02 20:39:05	Lokomotiv	In my home town of Zaporozhye, Ukraine, the population's attitude toward homosexuals was extremely negative
2014-03-02 20:39:27	Lokomotiv	Up to lynching
2014-03-02 20:40:30	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: see what they're making us do? We're talking about homosexuals when we should be thinking about real issues.
2014-03-02 20:41:33	JohnTheSavage101	Who'll prosper if gay laws are passed? The homosexuals. Who'll lose if gay laws aren't passed. The homosexuals. Where's the majority? Nowhere.
2014-03-02 20:42:04	JohnTheSavage101	It's a distraction from what's really aching the majority of societies
2014-03-02 20:42:28	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, it is a less important issue than let's say economics
2014-03-02 20:42:32	Lokomotiv	But it is still an issue
2014-03-02 20:42:47	JohnTheSavage101	Education, infrastructure, welfare, corruption. There are real issues.
2014-03-02 20:43:08	Lokomotiv	I do not want my son to go to a school with homosexual children, be taught that being gay is ok (homotolerance or whatever they call it in Europe), etc
2014-03-02 20:44:27	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: do you actually have a son?
2014-03-02 20:51:12	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: next time you see a man, don't tell him to stop being gay because he's probably not, but take his ciggarettes and his vodka (:P) if you have the gutts to back the words you just said some minutes ago about how these two things are also an issue
2014-03-02 21:00:48	Ge	JohnTheSavage101: I am a bachelor of behavioural science graduate and my masters research is in the social sciences in a master of business administration (professional accounting).  It seems to me that being a homosexual is not a choice.  Male foetus brains synthesise a hormone dihydrotestostorone (DHT) from a another hormone called estradiol.  The DHT masculinises the brain during prenatal development.  There are drugs and different environmental conditions
2014-03-02 21:00:48	Ge	 that disrupt this process at different stages and produce homosexual behaviour in the offspring.
2014-03-02 21:01:24	JohnTheSavage101	Ge: yeah, but treating it like it's a disease is ridiculous
2014-03-02 21:02:05	JohnTheSavage101	Ge: it's not something harmful like a narcissistic or antisocial personality
2014-03-02 21:03:01	Ge	The condition can arise where a drug or environmental condition either disrupts disrupts the aromatisation of estradiol into dihydrotestostorone, prevents estradiol getting into the brain or breaks down DHT after its production.
2014-03-02 21:03:41	Ge	Genetics can cause it too, people can miss a protein responsible for producing the hormones.  Sometimes, they are insensitive to the DHT in one or more tissues too, which can cause it.
2014-03-02 21:03:42	JohnTheSavage101	Ge: the only thing that bugs me about homosexuals is their flamboyancy, but considering just how many straight men fit that description, it would be illogical to hate only flamboyant homosexuals
2014-03-02 21:04:03	Ge	JohnTheSavage101: Sure, I would not say it is a psychiatric illness.  I just mean I do not think choose it.
2014-03-02 21:04:17	Ge	JohnTheSavage101: Yar, that annoys me too... haha.
2014-03-02 21:08:40	JohnTheSavage101	Ge: in the end no-one choose who/what they are. We're all walking psychiatric illnesses.
2014-03-02 21:10:06	Ge	JohnTheSavage101: Ah... I guess I think behaviour is predictable.  Even if matter wholly determines behaviour, I suspect choice is tied up in the process rather than not there.
2014-03-02 21:10:24	Ge	JohnTheSavage101: LOL, I do not think everyone is mentally ill.
2014-03-02 21:10:31	JohnTheSavage101	Ge: well, I do
2014-03-02 21:10:46	Ge	I do not think gay people either for that matter because it does not really make them suffer per se.
2014-03-02 21:10:50	Ge	JohnTheSavage101: Haha, how come?
2014-03-02 21:11:24	JohnTheSavage101	Ge: ok, I'm stretching the definition of the word, but I've found that most people are nevrotic in some way or another
2014-03-02 21:12:09	Ge	Yeah, well, that is it I guess.  Some mental illnesses are unusual, but most of them are just exaggerated versions of what everyone goes through.
2014-03-02 21:12:34	Ge	We get sad, angry, anxious etc time-to-time, people with most of those things just get it a lot more.
2014-03-02 21:13:36	Ge	People are generally a lot sadder than what people think they are too.  Basically, because mostly people do not show that they are unhappy when socialising with people and that due to it being a bit taboo and that.

2014-03-03 23:09:07	JohnTheSavage101	deanclkclk: there's a political war right now
2014-03-03 23:11:41	Fyr	is there anyone who lives in the Ukraine?

2014-03-03 23:17:25	deanclkclk	so Romanians are siding with the EU/US
2014-03-03 23:18:03	deanclkclk	because, I know the current unelected gov in Kiev is made up of fascist and nazis
2014-03-03 23:18:22	JohnTheSavage101	deanclkclk: yep. There's no way of us siding with the russians. Most romanians hate them. (I don't care about them, really)
2014-03-03 23:18:27	deanclkclk	some idealistic idiots but, the majority are fascist 
2014-03-03 23:18:41	deanclkclk	why romanians hate them?

2014-03-03 23:21:12	deanclkclk	well the eastern blocks is suffering post Russian imperialism but, most people from other countries are suffering US/EU imperialism

2014-03-03 23:22:21	Fyr	JohnTheSavage101, do citizens of your country justify Nazis?
2014-03-03 23:22:43	deanclkclk	no one voted for these people in Keiv and even Victoria Nuland plotted to overthrow the democratically elected government of Keiv; regardless if the guy is pro russian or not

2014-03-05 20:51:18	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: you know, I kept thinking that the guys walking in Ukrainian government buildings with neo-fascist symbols on their arms was a set up done by the russian media or an exageration or those people in the video making money by posing for the reporters o_O
2014-03-05 20:51:40	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, it was not :)
2014-03-05 20:52:13	JohnTheSavage101	This is disturbing
2014-03-05 20:53:49	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, exactly :)
2014-03-05 20:54:59	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, Russia's show of force has calmed them down a little bit, but I do not think that's for long
2014-03-05 20:56:13	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, on the other hand, if they will keep on adhering to their ideology they have a good chance of restoring order and prosperity in the country
2014-03-05 20:56:37	Lokomotiv	So far they were following its 1940s version to the fullest extent
2014-03-05 20:57:14	Lokomotiv	(similar to economic rise of Germany in 1930s)
2014-03-05 21:08:57	Fyr	Lokomotiv, if they follow their ideology, we will extend our boundaries much sooner.
2014-03-05 21:11:39	Fyr	why there is no one from the Ukraine?
2014-03-05 21:12:00	Lokomotiv	Fyr, well, based on the recent news it seems that Russia is not going to extend its boundaries any time soom
2014-03-05 21:12:27	Lokomotiv	Looks like the West managed to find a way to control Russia's actions

2014-03-05 21:14:51	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: actually, I'm quite surprised that Russia hasn't backed down yet
2014-03-05 21:15:09	JohnTheSavage101	Means they haven't been getting serious threats
2014-03-05 21:15:35	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, I guess they will eventually - sanction threats were serious enough for them
2014-03-05 21:15:55	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, but if they won't I will have a deeper respect for Russia :)
2014-03-05 21:18:23	Fyr	why there weren't sanctions when we annexated Abkhazia?
2014-03-05 21:18:58	Lokomotiv	It is not so close to NATO's borders
2014-03-05 21:20:59	Lokomotiv	Fyr, besides that Ukraine has a higher strategic meaning for Russia due to specific factories and research centers located there
2014-03-05 21:21:28	Fyr	research centers?
2014-03-05 21:21:48	Fyr	what do they investigate - lard?
2014-03-05 21:22:52	Lokomotiv	Fyr, missile technologies, aviation, etc
2014-03-05 21:23:27	Lokomotiv	Fyr, they were inherited from Soviet Union
2014-03-05 21:23:35	Lokomotiv	and many of them are still operational
2014-03-05 21:23:49	Lokomotiv	Without Russia they are agonizing
2014-03-05 21:24:01	Lokomotiv	But they will be extremely useful for Russia
2014-03-05 21:24:26	Lokomotiv	As by capturring them Russia will restore the full research and manufactureing cycle
2014-03-05 21:24:35	Lokomotiv	for many branches of technology
2014-03-05 21:24:44	Lokomotiv	*military technology
2014-03-05 21:25:53	Lokomotiv	I do not think that NATO would appreciate Russia's recovery of part of the Soviet military might
2014-03-05 21:26:40	Fyr	I'll vote for Putin if he makes it.

2014-03-05 21:53:25	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, I am tolerant to sexual minorities to the extent defined by the law. I believe that homosexuality is a disease which must be cured and will welcome any advances in the medicine that would allow to do it without significant damage to the patient's health (which is unfortunately a drawback of the current gay-to-straight conversion therapy)

2014-03-05 21:56:51	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, I know only three alcoholics (not sure if they are alive yet though)
2014-03-05 21:58:27	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: which of the three issues that we mentioned above (homosexuality, drug addiction, alchoholism) is/are the most serious and more likely to be met while walking down the street? :P
2014-03-05 21:58:38	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, IRL I do not know and drug addicts (even though some of my friends had relatives following this path)
2014-03-05 22:00:54	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: I'm a radical teetotaler, can't stand smoking and I abhorre the concept of drugs, but I don't give a damn about homosexuality because the only thing that it does do is make a minority of men and women reject their biological roles
2014-03-05 22:01:50	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: if it were up to me, I'd ban smoking and drinking and invest a lot in anti-drug campaigns
2014-03-05 22:02:18	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, IRL I do not know any homosexuals (but the fact that I do not know any does not mean that I have not encountered any)
2014-03-05 22:02:41	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: personally, I've seen more people's lives being ruined by alchohol and have yet to meet a homosexual
2014-03-05 22:03:51	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, as for encountering one of those issues on the american streets it depends on where you live :)
2014-03-05 22:04:05	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: I'm romania
2014-03-05 22:04:10	JohnTheSavage101	*romaniaN
2014-03-05 22:04:15	Lokomotiv	Oh yeah, sorry, I forgot about it
2014-03-05 22:05:10	Lokomotiv	Well here our opinions differ
2014-03-05 22:05:44	Lokomotiv	In terms of drinking I like the american law in accordance to which you won't be served in the bar if you are drunk
2014-03-05 22:06:03	Lokomotiv	+public consumption of alcohol is prohibited
2014-03-05 22:07:04	Lokomotiv	I do not think that we need to go beyond that point
2014-03-05 22:07:44	Lokomotiv	As far as smoking goes - there are state-wide ordinances currently being enabled in some states, which would also prohibit smoking in public places
2014-03-05 22:08:09	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: I'd ban it completely as it screws up passive smokers
2014-03-05 22:08:38	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: I don't want to get health problems just by standing next to you
2014-03-05 22:08:42	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, well, if you smoke at your private property - who cares
2014-03-05 22:08:49	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, I do not smoke :)
2014-03-05 22:09:01	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: was talking generally
2014-03-05 22:09:11	JohnTheSavage101	*generally speaking
2014-03-05 22:09:24	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, ban for smoking at public places would achieve exactly that
2014-03-05 22:09:53	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: even private ones such as home
2014-03-05 22:09:55	JohnTheSavage101	*homes
2014-03-05 22:10:23	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, well, here I won't agree with you, as you can do whatever you want at your private property
2014-03-05 22:10:37	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: subjecting a child to your bad vice that you got by trying to look cool when you were a kid isn't something nice
2014-03-05 22:10:41	Lokomotiv	Now, if homosexuality would also be limited to private properties - I would be fine
2014-03-05 22:11:20	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: think that it's already limited to private properties :P
2014-03-05 22:11:34	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, it is not
2014-03-05 22:11:56	Lokomotiv	There are people that are "openly gay" and that try to do it a part of their personality
2014-03-05 22:13:17	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: well, I don't agree with telling everyong that you're gay just for the sake of it and it kinda irritates me, but histrionics are a part of society
2014-03-05 22:13:18	Lokomotiv	If they would silently fuck each other in the arse when nobody sees them - I do not like their choice, I have no respect for them, but I will keep it to myself
2014-03-05 22:13:49	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: some buy expensive clothing to stand out, some turn gay
2014-03-05 22:14:07	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, I am OK with the first ones, I despise the second ones
2014-03-05 22:14:27	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: how ironic, I hate the opposite :D
2014-03-05 22:15:16	Lokomotiv	JohnTheSavage101, well you'd hate me in this case :)
2014-03-05 22:16:04	Lokomotiv	though, it depends on what you call expensive :)
2014-03-05 22:16:13	Lokomotiv	'cause what I buy is not expensive for me
2014-03-05 22:19:39	JohnTheSavage101	Lokomotiv: truth is that most people do this, and I kinda despise most people, and I'm just being stubborn by holding unto this hatred for most things expensive :P
2014-03-05 22:19:47	JohnTheSavage101	*most expensive things
2014-03-05 22:20:52	JohnTheSavage101	I blame western culture

2014-03-09 11:20:16	Fyr	брат как уехал в Голландию, так у него ломка по творогу началась.
2014-03-09 11:20:38	Lokomotiv	Fyr, творог у нас называется Cottage Cheese
2014-03-09 11:20:47	Lokomotiv	может твоему брату поможет :)
2014-03-09 11:21:06	Fyr	Lokomotiv, a по-вкусу он как творог?
2014-03-09 11:21:15	Lokomotiv	По вкусу он охуенен
2014-03-09 11:21:22	Fyr	отлично.
2014-03-09 11:21:32	Lokomotiv	Я туда добавляю варенье и получается вкусно
2014-03-09 11:21:36	Lokomotiv	Но можно есть и так
2014-03-09 11:21:41	Fyr	потому что даже у нас закваски могут быть разными.
2014-03-09 11:22:01	Fyr	Lokomotiv, а у вас есть тёртая ягода с сахаром?
2014-03-09 11:22:13	Fyr	не джем, не варенье, а именно вот это?
2014-03-09 11:22:27	Lokomotiv	гмм, не видел
2014-03-09 11:22:37	Lokomotiv	Но я что-то такого и на Украине не видел
2014-03-09 11:23:07	Lokomotiv	в продаже, я имею в виду
2014-03-09 11:23:33	Fyr	на любом рынку у почти любой бабки.
2014-03-09 11:23:41	Lokomotiv	но собственно, Fyr, при наличии в продаже ягод и сахара круглый год - это не проблема
2014-03-09 11:23:46	Fyr	у нас в магазинах продают.
2014-03-09 11:24:41	Lokomotiv	Fyr, врать не буду - не видел
2014-03-09 11:25:00	Lokomotiv	Хотя, тут есть так называемые "фермерские рынки" (аналог базара)
2014-03-09 11:25:05	Lokomotiv	Возможно там что-то такое и есть
2014-03-09 11:25:08	Lokomotiv	Я просто там не бываю

2014-03-26 19:54:23	Qantourisc	Fyr: beeing inside the norm
2014-03-26 20:05:42	Lokomotiv	Qantourisc, well, I can't believe that it is the same everywhere in Europe
2014-03-26 20:06:00	Qantourisc	the norm is just that
2014-03-26 20:06:41	Lokomotiv	I am from Ukraine myself (which is kind of considered Easter Europe), and if you don't conform to the norm over there, don't be surprised if the shit gets beaten out of you
2014-03-26 20:08:18	Qantourisc	I mean the "real" Europe (no disrespect)
2014-03-26 20:09:01	Lokomotiv	I kind of agree with you on that (it is going to be Russia soon, anyway)
2014-03-26 20:09:43	Lokomotiv	But as for the real Europe - do you mean that if I don't like my neighbor being gay - I will be frowned upon?
2014-03-26 20:10:40	Qantourisc	Lokomotiv: good luck on beeing Russia :)
2014-03-26 20:11:08	Lokomotiv	Well, man, you can just wish me luck with beeing an american :)
2014-03-26 20:11:11	Qantourisc	No, unless you misthread them :)
2014-03-26 20:11:16	Lokomotiv	As it is closer to reality
2014-03-26 20:11:38	Qantourisc	sorry but can't talk now ...
2014-03-26 20:13:16	Lokomotiv	np
2014-03-26 20:13:26	Lokomotiv	good luck with whatever you are busy with
2014-03-26 20:15:09	Qantourisc	getting weasyprint to work on windows like on linux
2014-03-26 20:15:24	Qantourisc	Doesn't look like hes accepting the base_url parameter
2014-03-26 20:15:55	Lokomotiv	why do you need weasyprint?
2014-03-26 20:16:04	Lokomotiv	what are you trying to do?
2014-03-26 20:16:10	Qantourisc	html > pdf
2014-03-26 20:17:28	Lokomotiv	put it in .doc
2014-03-26 20:17:48	Lokomotiv	and use Microsoft's free plug-in for Word to do the job
2014-03-26 20:17:49	Lokomotiv	:)
2014-03-26 20:18:15	Qantourisc	That would be conforming to the norm, we talked about that :D

2014-04-27 20:02:19	Ge	Fyr: Nah, that basically ended with the Statute of Westminster.
2014-04-27 20:02:53	Ge	Fyr: It gave the British, Australian, New Zealand and Canadian parliament equal precedence and legislative authorities.
2014-04-27 20:03:24	Ge	It made it so the imperial parliament could only legislate for the dominions at their request.
2014-04-27 20:03:42	Fyr	why wikipedia says that you have monarchy?
2014-04-27 20:03:57	Fyr	with British queen. =\
2014-04-27 20:04:09	Ge	Then, following the Australia Act 1984 (UK & Cth), Britain lost all legislative authority over Australia and the Australian states.
2014-04-27 20:04:27	Ge	Well, we have the same Queen as Britain.
2014-04-27 20:04:48	Fyr	so, you have held a referendum?
2014-04-27 20:04:57	Fyr	like the Crimea?
2014-04-27 20:05:27	Ge	The British government cannot use this to control the Australian government though, because the Queen can only exercise the reserve powers if personally present in Australia.  Otherwise, only the governor-general and governors can exercise them.
2014-04-27 20:05:49	Fyr	ok
2014-04-27 20:06:13	Ge	Nope, there was no referendum.  The Australia Act(s) were just legislative acts of each the UK parliament, the Australian federal parliament and the parliament of the six Australian states.
2014-04-27 20:06:24	Ge	* parliaments of the six
2014-04-27 20:07:16	Ge	There was referendums to adopt the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1901 (Imp), which federated Australia from the six British colonies it was.
2014-04-27 20:07:53	Ge	No, referendum on the gradual legal independence of the Commonwealth from the Imperial parliament though.
2014-04-27 20:08:28	Ge	It was just high court cases (through the doctrine of stare decisis under common law) and through acts of different parliaments.
2014-04-27 20:09:43	Fyr	Ge, this information is enough.
2014-04-27 20:09:59	Fyr	we are not planning on conquering Australia.
2014-04-27 20:10:30	Ge	LOL, fair enough.
2014-04-27 20:10:42	Ge	Nah, I just thought you were interested in our constitutional law.
2014-04-27 20:10:58	Ge	Russia's would be interesting too because of the dissolution of the USSR.
2014-04-27 20:11:14	Ge	I do not know how continuous or cut and start anew it was.
2014-04-27 20:14:42	Fyr	Ge, does Australia's media support the mass hysteria about Russian invasion in the Ukraine?
2014-04-27 20:15:54	Ge	I do not know, to be honest.  I hardly watch TV nowadays.  I basically pick and choose my news online.  For a couple days, it seemed to say Russia was invading Ukraine.  Now, there is basically zero mentioned of it.  People seem more worried about the federal budget.
2014-04-27 20:16:09	Ge	There is some G20 meeting too, which gets all the coverage.
2014-04-27 20:17:13	Ge	News Corp I think was a bit biased against Russia.  Sydney Morning Herald, a good newspaper, was more balanced.  It recognised Crimea is strategically important for Russia, but noted there was a lot of popular support there for incorporation into the Russian Federation.
2014-04-27 20:17:34	Ge	Mr Murdoch's papers seemed to forget this time-to-time.
2014-04-27 20:17:41	Ge	That is about all I know about the coverage.
2014-04-27 20:19:07	Ge	Fyr: What reassurance I can give you is that it does not seem to have reflected badly on the Russian people.
2014-04-27 20:19:46	Ge	Fyr: I have not heard one iota about Russia or its people per se being bad.  Where there is attacking words, they tend to be against Putin and not Russia so much.
2014-04-27 20:21:59	Ge	I should sleep.  I need to wake up early'ish and help a Chinese person with an assignment about accounting theory or something.
2014-04-27 20:22:03	Ge	Good night!
