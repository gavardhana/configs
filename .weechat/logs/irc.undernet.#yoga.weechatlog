2014-03-03 23:09:29	Cozmobozo	maybe it means you the united heathen front
2014-03-03 23:09:45	Cozmobozo	somewhere out of space and time 
2014-03-03 23:09:51	Cozmobozo	and obviously not here and now
2014-03-03 23:10:16	@Zelator	for your sweet information mr. asshead, i was simply invited in here and given op for no particular reason, but just out of friendly disposition
2014-03-03 23:10:28	@Zelator	so no, i'm not running anything together with 42
2014-03-03 23:10:36	@Zelator	in fact, he never even talks in here
2014-03-03 23:10:56	Cozmobozo	maybe he does yoga in here
2014-03-03 23:11:02	 *	Cozmobozo checks where here is
2014-03-03 23:11:03	@Zelator	so you may well think he doesn't exist on this channel as he doesn't even bother to keep it clean

2014-03-03 23:15:19	@Zelator	You're never serious, you're never happy, you're never sad, you're just being a clown. Senseless, emotionless and stoned
2014-03-03 23:15:21	Cozmobozo	you are sick
2014-03-03 23:15:44	@Zelator	like a machine basically
2014-03-03 23:15:49	@Zelator	you're never different!
2014-03-03 23:15:52	@Zelator	you have no moods
2014-03-03 23:16:04	@Zelator	it's just.. this
2014-03-03 23:16:04	Cozmobozo	really 
2014-03-03 23:16:20	@Zelator	yeah, really.. i dunno, even if someone punches you that probably wouldn't change anything
2014-03-03 23:16:24	Cozmobozo	and the mean itself can be the only other reason of your problem
2014-03-03 23:16:26	@Zelator	well.. in best case you'd just go quiet
2014-03-03 23:16:47	Cozmobozo	you wanna call me a troll
2014-03-03 23:16:57	@Zelator	i don't even know if you're that
2014-03-03 23:16:57	Cozmobozo	i know 
2014-03-03 23:17:10	@Zelator	troll has a particular goal, he gotta have fun
2014-03-03 23:17:20	Cozmobozo	like you 
2014-03-03 23:17:27	@Zelator	what's your goal i indeed have failed to apprehend
2014-03-03 23:17:28	Cozmobozo	why you made hermetics

2014-03-03 23:17:50	@Zelator	nice try, funny at least
2014-03-03 23:18:10	@Zelator	Oh, i don't think that would be possible. He's behind the fence too now. And i have to admit, he's much much worse than you
2014-03-03 23:18:38	@Zelator	he's not a troll, but he's worse than that
2014-03-03 23:19:06	@Zelator	he's got a very powerful skill to annoy the shit out of people without even intending to or saying much
2014-03-03 23:19:12	Cozmobozo	define something south of trolls
2014-03-03 23:19:16	@Zelator	it's like he just starts typing and it's already annoying and you wanna kill him
2014-03-03 23:19:26	@Zelator	and it took me a while to get tired of you
2014-03-03 23:19:41	@Zelator	nevertheless, i can't say i was ever mad at you or seriously irritated, nah..
2014-03-03 23:19:50	Cozmobozo	see
2014-03-03 23:20:00	@Zelator	i just coldly decided you wouldn't even mourn your exile
2014-03-03 23:20:03	Cozmobozo	the only thing you hate is how i treat women remember
2014-03-03 23:20:24	@Zelator	huh? That's new
2014-03-03 23:20:29	Cozmobozo	you turned on me because you didnt understand the goes i was having at hela
2014-03-03 23:20:44	Cozmobozo	she started the lets ban me and you followed in
2014-03-03 23:20:45	Cozmobozo	i remember
2014-03-03 23:21:06	Cozmobozo	because i called her a stuck in the clouds beep
2014-03-03 23:21:33	Cozmobozo	that turned you 
2014-03-03 23:21:53	Cozmobozo	you couldnt realize i have past or agenda either
2014-03-03 23:22:04	@Zelator	it's not that i saw anything super offensive, but it was enough that one respectable and high ranking member of our channel got annoyed with you, so naturally i would value her more than you, since it wasn't by any chance that she and some other people deemed you disturbing
2014-03-03 23:22:26	Cozmobozo	disturbing 
2014-03-03 23:22:26	@Zelator	so it was a matter of courtesy really
2014-03-03 23:22:31	Cozmobozo	i like being disturbing 
2014-03-03 23:22:39	Cozmobozo	what can disturb you people
2014-03-03 23:22:41	Cozmobozo	im interested
2014-03-03 23:22:46	Cozmobozo	tell me all about it plz
2014-03-03 23:22:50	@Zelator	can you actually be anything else? Oh, i forgot.. dasnichts said that on facebook you're pretty adequate
2014-03-03 23:23:34	Cozmobozo	adequate facebook?
2014-03-03 23:23:40	Cozmobozo	wtf is that meaning of
2014-03-03 23:23:42	@Zelator	Well then it's even more annoying. A guy who can be normal deliberately does shit to annoy people around him. Our channel is not a depository of your insecurities and all other stuff
2014-03-03 23:23:44	Cozmobozo	i preffer chat
2014-03-03 23:24:11	@Zelator	yes, adequate facebook

2014-03-03 23:25:07	Cozmobozo	so unban me with a probation
2014-03-03 23:25:23	@Zelator	I could unban you any time, but what's the point? You gonna start polluting it with all kinds of random shit.. just endless text that nobody bothers reading.. basically like alien, only that your text is just redundant, whilst his is ultra obnoxious
2014-03-03 23:25:26	Cozmobozo	you can shift the responsibility to das
2014-03-03 23:25:42	Cozmobozo	he can be my probationer
2014-03-03 23:25:58	Cozmobozo	ok lets go then 
2014-03-03 23:26:01	Cozmobozo	:)
2014-03-03 23:26:37	Cozmobozo	i have a hunch if we take even this there
2014-03-03 23:26:48	Cozmobozo	something may become 
2014-03-03 23:28:23	Cozmobozo	has anyone noted how intravertedness is being villified the last month
2014-03-03 23:28:27	@Zelator	got 5 bucks?
2014-03-03 23:28:42	@Zelator	i want you to be useful at least
2014-03-03 23:28:49	@Zelator	if you give me 5 bucks i won't ever ban you again
2014-03-03 23:29:06	Cozmobozo	you take so lil time for this
