2014-03-09 16:27:45	laikas	psy ive come o an astonishing realisation today
2014-03-09 16:28:06	laikas	the vast majority of germanic language speakers... with the exception of most germans... speak english fairly well
2014-03-09 16:28:42	laikas	the duthies, danes, norwegians, swedes, etc generally have a high standard of english
2014-03-09 16:28:56	laikas	dutchies*
2014-03-09 16:29:03	laikas	as well as some germans
2014-03-09 16:29:11	laikas	but most germans speak it appallingly
2014-03-09 16:29:30	laikas	and ehy is that you ask...?
2014-03-09 16:29:41	laikas	because the other xountries all use subtitles
2014-03-09 16:29:51	laikas	but the germans dub everything...

2014-03-09 17:44:48	gobblette	i didn't know i normally had to be talking to anyone in particular, if i wanted to say "good day"
2014-03-09 17:45:38	gobblette	or "מה שלומכה" (how are you all)
2014-03-09 17:46:47	totimkopf	snap
2014-03-09 17:48:40	colonolGron	good day to you too gobblette :)
2014-03-09 17:48:55	colonolGron	i was just asking because i was interested who spoke hebrew
2014-03-09 17:49:08	gobblette	א דאנק (a dank) (thank you)
2014-03-09 17:49:22	gobblette	some of it's hebrew... some of it's yiddish
2014-03-09 17:49:42	colonolGron	ah i see
2014-03-09 17:50:26	gobblette	i'm a beginner to yiddish and it already makes more sense than hebrw
2014-03-09 17:50:29	gobblette	hebrew*
2014-03-09 17:50:35	gobblette	because i'm used to european languages
2014-03-09 17:51:03	totimkopf	yiddish is pretty cool
2014-03-09 18:03:41	gobblette	i consider it part of my cultural heritage... although i don't consider myself technically jewish
2014-03-09 18:03:46	gobblette	my father is Jewish
2014-03-09 18:04:10	gobblette	and i was raised as if i was
2014-03-09 18:05:33	gobblette	lately i'm just starting to acknowledge that i'm just as anglo-american as i am Jewish. although i'm not really either... i'm just American, or a world citizen even.

2014-03-09 19:39:05	xiang	hi
2014-03-09 19:39:10	Kingsy	I was hoping to get some advice on learning chinese before I start..
2014-03-09 19:39:22	xiang	before you start? :P
2014-03-09 19:39:34	Kingsy	don't know if there is someone that speaks cantonese or mandarin?
2014-03-09 19:39:44	Kingsy	xiang: yes :)

2014-03-09 19:40:11	xiang	step one: start
2014-03-09 19:40:25	Kingsy	xiang: well, no I firstly need to decide which lanuage to start on
2014-03-09 19:40:29	xiang	mandarin
2014-03-09 19:40:40	Kingsy	why?
2014-03-09 19:40:53	Kingsy	I am not saying your wrong, I am just looking to find out which
2014-03-09 19:41:10	Kingsy	I hear mandarin is easier to start with?

2014-03-09 19:41:43	xiang	because it's spoken by 15% of humankind? :p
2014-03-09 19:42:22	Kingsy	oh, so cantonese is less known? used less?
2014-03-09 19:42:43	xiang	cantonese is spoken in southern china and is usually associated with hong kong
2014-03-09 19:42:49	xiang	so unless you're planning to relocate to HK
2014-03-09 19:42:53	xiang	i see no practical reason to learn it
2014-03-09 19:43:10	xiang	it is common in overseas chinese communities as cantonese speakers were the first to emigrate
2014-03-09 19:43:22	xiang	but now mandarin is just as widespread
2014-03-09 19:43:33	xiang	and a lot of cantonese speakers understand mandarin
2014-03-09 19:44:09	xiang	and yes, mandarin is less difficult
2014-03-09 19:45:13	Kingsy	ok, also, I am not going to get much of a chance to speak with chinese people, or at least in the near future. So I was also thinking I might watch chinese movies with / without subs... does this help?
2014-03-09 19:45:36	Kingsy	hehe I hope most chinese movies are not in cantonese :)
2014-03-09 19:46:34	xiang	HK cinema is much more prolific than chinese/taiwanese etc
2014-03-09 19:46:42	xiang	but there are plenty of movies in mandarin
2014-03-09 19:46:52	xiang	and there are chinese people everywhere
2014-03-09 19:46:56	Kingsy	HK cinema is in cantonese?
2014-03-09 19:46:59	xiang	yes
2014-03-09 19:47:07	Kingsy	crap
2014-03-09 19:47:45	Kingsy	I know there are people I can talk to, but until I have at least a little grasp its kinda pointless :)
2014-03-09 19:48:40	xiang	maybe try michel thomas to start with. i have not heard the mandarin course, but i think they are a pretty good entry point for languages
2014-03-09 19:48:48	xiang	especially the ones that aren't done by michel thomas ;p
2014-03-09 19:49:31	xiang	chinese is simple enough that you can communicate a fair amount with a limited vocabulary
2014-03-09 19:49:44	Kingsy	I was thinking rosetta stone, a friend of mine has  acopy
2014-03-09 19:49:51	xiang	outside of the speaking part, you really need to learn to read
2014-03-09 19:50:08	xiang	most language enthusiasts will tell you rosetta stone is pretty useless
2014-03-09 19:50:19	Kingsy	damn.. I see
2014-03-09 19:51:02	Karavinka	:o

2014-03-09 19:51:48	Kingsy	so what is michel thomas? just audio books?
2014-03-09 19:52:09	xiang	audio course
2014-03-09 19:52:18	Karavinka	yes, but i'm pretty sure any michel thomas will teach you more than rosetta stone
2014-03-09 19:52:32	xiang	oh, and chinese pod

2014-03-09 19:52:55	Kingsy	I will try that out, if its good I will invest in a copy

2014-03-09 19:53:46	Kingsy	hehe wow
2014-03-09 19:53:47	xiang	the best lessons are the ones with john from sinosplice. unfortunately, a lot of the beginner lessons are done by a guy called ken
2014-03-09 19:53:50	xiang	who has a terrible accent
2014-03-09 19:53:55	xiang	and i can't stand listening to him
2014-03-09 19:54:21	Karavinka	lol
2014-03-09 19:54:21	Kingsy	so what is Chinesepod? audio book again?
2014-03-09 19:54:27	xiang	it's more of a podcast
2014-03-09 19:54:30	xiang	individual lessons
2014-03-09 19:54:38	Kingsy	ok cool
2014-03-09 19:54:38	xiang	that cover a single dialog
2014-03-09 19:54:41	xiang	then they discuss the dialog

2014-03-09 19:56:32	Kingsy	what is that?
2014-03-09 19:57:00	Karavinka	uz-translations is probably the largest pirated language learning resources collection in existence as of now.
2014-03-09 19:57:09	Leopejo	I would also suggest Pimsleur for a beginner.
2014-03-09 19:57:14	 *	Leopejo runs away
2014-03-09 19:57:28	Karavinka	you can spend hours browsing different kinds of resources (rather than actually using any of them)
2014-03-09 19:57:43	Karavinka	Leopejo: I like Pimsleur!
2014-03-09 19:57:58	Kingsy	wow SO MUCH INFO
2014-03-09 19:58:09	Kingsy	so do you guys all speak multiple languages?
2014-03-09 19:58:18	Karavinka	no.. we just pretend
2014-03-09 19:58:18	xiang	hah, i can't stand pimsleur
2014-03-09 19:58:37	tseno	bonjour Leopejo :)
2014-03-09 19:58:42	Leopejo	I love Pimsleur but only as an introduction to real study.
2014-03-09 19:58:44	Leopejo	hello tseno
2014-03-09 19:58:59	tseno	Leopejo: i saw your picture :)
2014-03-09 19:59:06	Karavinka	my estimate on average number of languages a LAL frequent is... maybe 2.5?
2014-03-09 19:59:09	Kingsy	I wonder if its even possible to a good grasp of a lanuage without living in the country
2014-03-09 19:59:17	Kingsy	I hope so
2014-03-09 19:59:27	Leopejo	that is terrible, tseno
2014-03-09 19:59:33	xiang	i barely even hit two. i only get .2 per language ;p
2014-03-09 19:59:41	Karavinka	it is absolutely possible, but depending on what drew you in for chinese
2014-03-09 19:59:42	xiang	.1 for some
2014-03-09 19:59:51	tseno	:(  why do you say that Leopejo
2014-03-09 20:00:00	Kingsy	Karavinka: what do you mean?
2014-03-09 20:00:04	xiang	Kingsy: it's only possible with sufficient motivation
2014-03-09 20:00:05	Leopejo	because I don't know what to say :P
2014-03-09 20:00:10	Kingsy	I hope so
2014-03-09 20:00:17	Kingsy	I don't have the money for travel right now
2014-03-09 20:00:29	xiang	and keep in mind that you really must learn the writing system
2014-03-09 20:00:33	tseno	Leopejo: i'm just infroming you :/
2014-03-09 20:00:39	Karavinka	Kingsy: if you have a lot of stuff you want to DO in chinese that you can do in your home country (wherever you're from) then you're good
2014-03-09 20:00:53	Leopejo	infrome me some fromage
2014-03-09 20:00:55	Kingsy	xiang: I heard the writing system could come later?
2014-03-09 20:00:58	Karavinka	if you're thinking "oh chinese is the next hot business language gotta give it a try"... then it's probably not going to work

2014-03-09 20:01:53	Karavinka	Kingsy: track down a copy of a book alled "Remembering the Hanzi" by a guy called Heisig if you're absolutely new to the writing system
2014-03-09 20:01:58	xiang	^
2014-03-09 20:02:10	Karavinka	and that one you'd want in a paper format
2014-03-09 20:02:15	Kingsy	ok
2014-03-09 20:02:17	xiang	http://torrentz.eu/601c3c81fa6c6d724612e900093330f560129b0b
2014-03-09 20:02:21	xiang	who needs paper
2014-03-09 20:02:29	Kingsy	haha
2014-03-09 20:02:36	xiang	just need anki :P
2014-03-09 20:02:39	Karavinka	haha
2014-03-09 20:02:42	xiang	there are pre-made heisig decks
2014-03-09 20:02:52	Karavinka	oh yeah, heisig on pdf + anki could do the job
2014-03-09 20:03:00	xiang	i used to do that a lot
2014-03-09 20:03:07	xiang	i haven't done active character study in years! :(\
2014-03-09 20:03:17	Kingsy	what is anki?
2014-03-09 20:03:30	xiang	it's a free flashcard app
2014-03-09 20:03:33	xiang	look it up
2014-03-09 20:03:33	stoned	Good morning
2014-03-09 20:03:47	Kingsy	hmm I cant access that page.. my isp blocked it
2014-03-09 20:03:48	Karavinka	and unlike everything else xiang suggests, it's legal to download it for free.
2014-03-09 20:03:48	Kingsy	poo
2014-03-09 20:03:49	Karavinka	hahaha
2014-03-09 20:03:57	xiang	:)
2014-03-09 20:04:35	xiang	well, it's pretty easy to summarize his method
2014-03-09 20:05:09	xiang	step 1: identify radicals or common components of characters, step 2: give them a name, step 3: use that name in a mnemonic
2014-03-09 20:05:23	xiang	that's all it is
2014-03-09 20:05:47	tseno	why does the book title insist on simplified ?
2014-03-09 20:06:11	Karavinka	tseno: if you want the traditional chinese, then you can just go for "remembering the kanji"
2014-03-09 20:06:12	xiang	because there's another for traditional
2014-03-09 20:06:16	tseno	oh wait .. i think i clicked on a wrong link
2014-03-09 20:06:22	xiang	and one for kanji :P
2014-03-09 20:06:37	Karavinka	oh there's a traditional chinese version for hanzi series/
2014-03-09 20:06:39	Karavinka	?
2014-03-09 20:06:41	xiang	yes
2014-03-09 20:06:42	Karavinka	didn't know
2014-03-09 20:06:58	Karavinka	i'm too awesome with characters to care about it now
2014-03-09 20:07:03	 *	Karavinka asshole
2014-03-09 20:07:06	xiang	shusha you face ;p
2014-03-09 20:07:26	xiang	i am mighty rusty
2014-03-09 20:07:49	xiang	i probably still know like 6-800
2014-03-09 20:08:20	Karavinka	pirated visual novels keep my kanji active
2014-03-09 20:08:22	xiang	i regret not doing more handwriting
2014-03-09 20:08:28	Karavinka	well, passive since i'm not handwriting anything
2014-03-09 20:08:33	xiang	yeah
2014-03-09 20:08:47	xiang	i didn't handwrite ANYTHING so it was almost entirely passive
2014-03-09 20:08:56	xiang	until i started doing heisig
2014-03-09 20:09:34	xiang	that's probably a better approach, internalizing stroke order and all
2014-03-09 20:10:12	Karavinka	but then again, i'm a full-blooded east asian so i'm genetically better evolved for kanji awesomeness :p
2014-03-09 20:10:31	xiang	i guess i'm only 50% equipped ;(
2014-03-09 20:10:47	Karavinka	i've done enough of writing exercises...
2014-03-09 20:11:21	Karavinka	after handcopying the analects, mencius, zhuangzi and a few other classical pieces
2014-03-09 20:11:32	Karavinka	i feel like... i'm out of here
2014-03-09 20:11:36	xiang	now i'm slightly motivated to grind character flashcards again :3
2014-03-09 20:12:01	Karavinka	oh well, i never finished zhuangzi. too long.
2014-03-09 20:12:09	xiang	i've been focusing entirely on romance lately
2014-03-09 20:12:16	xiang	trying to pound all that grammar into my thick skull
2014-03-09 20:12:53	Karavinka	for one moment i thought you meant... you're reading chinese harlequin
2014-03-09 20:12:56	Karavinka	sorry
2014-03-09 20:14:19	xiang	ahaha

2014-03-09 20:29:25	Karavinka	tseno: i went medieval in my attempts to learn classical chinese and japanese
2014-03-09 20:29:39	Karavinka	great exercise, by the way.

2014-03-09 20:30:55	Kingsy	I am trying to figure out what it does :)
2014-03-09 20:31:08	tseno	Karavinka: why physically ?
2014-03-09 20:31:30	Karavinka	tseno: try writing 20 pages of chinese..or any language with your hand.
2014-03-09 20:31:33	xiang	download it, register an account, go to 'shared decks' and download a deck
2014-03-09 20:32:08	Karavinka	it's a physical labour that rewards you with awesome grasp of the grammar
2014-03-09 20:32:25	tseno	oh... i see Karavinka :)   i might try that
2014-03-09 20:32:44	xiang	ugh, i really need to lay off the whiskey

2014-03-09 20:33:02	xiang	i'm going to give myself a damn ulcer
2014-03-09 20:33:02	Kingsy	xiang: there are like hundreds.. how do I know which to try out?
2014-03-09 20:34:21	xiang	trial and error?
2014-03-09 20:34:28	Karavinka	hundreds of.. what?
2014-03-09 20:34:45	xiang	free decks
2014-03-09 20:34:53	Karavinka	aha
2014-03-09 20:35:31	xiang	Kingsy: another word of advice... doing is more important than talking about doing or thinking about doing
2014-03-09 20:35:31	Karavinka	i personally prefer making my custom ones... i could never get to actually using premade ones
2014-03-09 20:35:33	Karavinka	but try a few
2014-03-09 20:35:38	xiang	if you are paralyzed by choice, you will accomplish nothing
2014-03-09 20:35:57	xiang	there are resources abound. get as money as you can, keep the ones you like, and use them
2014-03-09 20:36:01	xiang	many*

2014-03-10 00:55:45	xiang	yeah, i've been doing some pricing
2014-03-10 00:56:07	Leopejo	I remember when a one way flight cost more than a round trip
2014-03-10 00:56:19	xiang	and bogota to rio is ~250US cheaper with a return flight
2014-03-10 00:56:49	xiang	it's about the same savings for rio to london
2014-03-10 00:57:19	xiang	i usually assume one way will be about the same, or only slightly cheaper than return
2014-03-10 00:57:35	xiang	but to be susbstantially MORE expensive than return i didn't expect

2014-03-26 19:35:45	Expug	xiang: it's the same count of samba de gafieira, only inverted. you join your feet in the middle for zouk, while in the extremities for samba
2014-03-26 19:36:16	Expug	in fact it seems zouk's basic step was invented this way on purpose to make it less obvious for people who dance samba and forró

2014-04-27 12:29:07	Leopejo	huf, Lumilintu taught me a word in Hungarian.
2014-04-27 12:29:15	huf	go on
2014-04-27 12:29:20	Lumilintu	which word?
2014-04-27 12:29:21	Leopejo	szia.
2014-04-27 12:29:23	Lumilintu	haha
2014-04-27 12:29:32	huf	szia
2014-04-27 12:30:00	Leopejo	I mean I knew its meaning (from context), but she formally explained me its meaning.
2014-04-27 12:30:43	Lumilintu	sziasztok :)
2014-04-27 12:31:14	huf	i dont know the formal explanation
2014-04-27 12:31:21	huf	especially for "sziasztok"
2014-04-27 12:31:51	huf	so, Lumilintu, do tell
2014-04-27 12:31:54	Lumilintu	I also didn't know I was formally explaining it
2014-04-27 12:32:15	Lumilintu	I guess I just said "hei"
2014-04-27 12:33:00	huf	i almost never use szia i think
2014-04-27 12:33:03	huf	mostly it's hejhej or hello
2014-04-27 12:33:18	huf	well, for saying good bye, i use szia
2014-04-27 12:33:25	Leopejo	you use szia here huf
2014-04-27 12:33:29	Lumilintu	I always say szia :o

2014-04-27 12:34:19	huf	szia just feels like i'm in a bad tv show :D
2014-04-27 12:34:42	huf	"hejhej" or "hello" or "na mivan hej" feel more organic
2014-04-27 12:38:51	Leopejo	so if I say szia now, it would mean bye?
2014-04-27 12:39:27	huf	no no, it still means hi or bye
2014-04-27 12:39:54	huf	it's just that as a greeting, it feels a bit like using "well met" in english
2014-04-27 12:39:57	huf	at least to me
2014-04-27 12:40:26	huf	well, at least if *i* say it. i dont think anything's weird if other people use it on me :)
2014-04-27 12:40:37	Leopejo	so what would I use for bye?
2014-04-27 12:40:50	huf	csa'

2014-04-27 13:15:08	laikas	i hope to never own a computer again for as long as i live, which im sure is doable
2014-04-27 13:15:22	laikas	how have you been?
2014-04-27 13:15:35	Lumilintu	I still don't get how a smartphone is better than a computer
2014-04-27 13:15:56	laikas	its not better lumi
2014-04-27 13:16:02	laikas	its more restrictive
2014-04-27 13:16:09	laikas	you cant do as much on it
2014-04-27 13:16:37	laikas	anyway its not about computers are better than phones or anything like that... its about living a minimalistic life
2014-04-27 13:16:46	decem	amish now?
2014-04-27 13:16:48	laikas	not being attached to earthly possessions
2014-04-27 13:16:50	tseno	laikas: you will be abducted by aliens .. and they will implant a computer in your head .. and make it run the oeuvre of mariah carey on a loop

2014-04-27 13:17:06	laikas	yes decem im trying to live a more amish lifestyle

2014-04-27 13:17:24	decem	any particular reason? or did you just get sick of computers and stuff?
2014-04-27 13:17:33	laikas	no way im having mariah carey on loop in my head
2014-04-27 13:17:43	laikas	decem i feel ive now transcended computers
2014-04-27 13:17:52	laikas	im not saying theyre evil or anything like that
2014-04-27 13:17:55	laikas	theyre great
2014-04-27 13:18:05	laikas	but i no longer have a need for a computer
2014-04-27 13:18:21	laikas	last ear i gave up my car and my tv, and i dont miss them at all
2014-04-27 13:18:31	laikas	giving up the computer was the next step
2014-04-27 13:18:48	decem	ah I see
2014-04-27 13:18:58	laikas	eventually i want to live a completely amish lifestyle, and be self sufficient, and grow my own crops and use gas lamps, etc
2014-04-27 13:19:02	decem	I've pretty much given up tv anyway, I'm just not interested in it
2014-04-27 13:19:03	laikas	but thats a long term goal
2014-04-27 13:19:11	laikas	same here decem
2014-04-27 13:19:20	laikas	you know eric has never owned a tv
2014-04-27 13:19:30	laikas	the whole time he was raising kids they didnt own a tv
2014-04-27 13:19:38	laikas	i didnt realise people lived like this
2014-04-27 13:19:44	laikas	i was so impressed when he told me
2014-04-27 13:19:52	decem	as for car.. well, I use public transport and I walk and bike, but for longer journeys I still use the car, just because it's helpful
2014-04-27 13:20:03	laikas	most parents use the tv as a babysitter... something to keep the kids occupied
2014-04-27 13:20:16	decem	yes laikas, it's not good
2014-04-27 13:20:31	laikas	decem he great thing about not owninga ca is, when people ask to meet me, i say "thats too far, youll have to come to me"

2014-04-27 13:21:41	decem	what???
2014-04-27 13:21:48	laikas	then add insurance, breakdown cover, servicing it, etc
2014-04-27 13:22:02	laikas	the car was such a money drainer
2014-04-27 13:22:09	laikas	and i would never walk to the shops

2014-04-27 13:23:13	laikas	lumi, but dont you see... thats great
2014-04-27 13:23:19	laikas	im not saying you cant own one
2014-04-27 13:23:20	Lumilintu	because you can constantly be online with a smartphone
2014-04-27 13:23:32	laikas	im saying i owned one for years... but theyre not for me anymore
2014-04-27 13:23:46	laikas	im definitely not constantly online lumi

2014-04-27 13:23:52	Lumilintu	:D
2014-04-27 13:23:56	Lumilintu	okay then :P
2014-04-27 13:23:57	decem	I'm not sure I could live without a computer, or at least a smartphone, not because I'm addicted but because it's so effective for communication and research, it's so much faster than anything
2014-04-27 13:24:00	laikas	you have much more free time than i do
2014-04-27 13:24:14	Lumilintu	I wouldn't say that, laikas
2014-04-27 13:24:17	laikas	decem, thats different, you have a need for a computer
2014-04-27 13:24:20	Lumilintu	I used to work full time, too
2014-04-27 13:24:26	laikas	i assume you need it for work or study
2014-04-27 13:24:30	laikas	i dont need one
2014-04-27 13:24:38	decem	I guess so yes
2014-04-27 13:24:40	decem	what's your job?
2014-04-27 13:24:42	laikas	lumi, used to doesnt mean you work full time now
2014-04-27 13:24:48	laikas	you dont work atm
2014-04-27 13:24:51	Lumilintu	yes
2014-04-27 13:24:54	Lumilintu	that's why I can compare :P
2014-04-27 13:24:55	laikas	and you havent for a while now
2014-04-27 13:25:08	laikas	well im comparig the present lumi, no the past
2014-04-27 13:25:14	Lumilintu	I used to work full time a bit more than half a year ago
2014-04-27 13:25:14	laikas	 децем им ан енглысх теацхер
2014-04-27 13:25:21	laikas	bah
2014-04-27 13:25:28	laikas	decem im an english teacher
2014-04-27 13:25:33	Lumilintu	and back then, I had much more time for everything
2014-04-27 13:25:48	decem	ah
2014-04-27 13:25:55	decem	so computer is not necessary
2014-04-27 13:25:57	laikas	i need one for work, but thats okay because i have a computer at work i can use... i dont need one for home
2014-04-27 13:26:01	decem	it would still be helpful
2014-04-27 13:26:10	decem	yes
2014-04-27 13:26:28	laikas	at home the only hing i need one for is my tax returns, but ill just go o a public library in september or october and do it there
2014-04-27 13:26:53	Lumilintu	what I meant is that my studies right now need more of a time effort than my work ever did
2014-04-27 13:27:07	laikas	i find that very hard to believe, lumi
2014-04-27 13:27:11	Lumilintu	when comparing my full time work to my studies
2014-04-27 13:27:24	laikas	lumi, do you attend class for 40 hours a week?
2014-04-27 13:27:36	laikas	im jot talking about what you do putside of class
2014-04-27 13:27:40	laikas	outside*
2014-04-27 13:27:50	Lumilintu	why not? that is part of studies, too
2014-04-27 13:27:52	laikas	im talking about lecture and tutorial times
2014-04-27 13:28:06	laikas	lumi  because i study in my own time as well
2014-04-27 13:28:13	laikas	i read books every night
2014-04-27 13:28:23	laikas	should i include that in my working week?
2014-04-27 13:28:41	laikas	if its something you enjoy, you will find time o do it, and do it anyway...
2014-04-27 13:28:49	Lumilintu	yes
2014-04-27 13:28:57	laikas	if you dont enjoy reading up on it, quit your studies now... theyre not for you
2014-04-27 13:29:06	Lumilintu	that was not my point
2014-04-27 13:29:13	laikas	you neer answered my question. btw
2014-04-27 13:29:17	laikas	which was my point
2014-04-27 13:29:32	laikas	do you have more than 40 contact hours per week at university?
2014-04-27 13:29:40	Lumilintu	I'd have to calculate
2014-04-27 13:29:44	laikas	of course not
2014-04-27 13:30:00	laikas	how many units are you enroled in this semester, lumi?
2014-04-27 13:30:29	Lumilintu	I don't know how you measure them
2014-04-27 13:30:48	Lumilintu	but I have 12 courses plus on additional course that is not official
2014-04-27 13:31:12	Lumilintu	and those 12 courses don't mean lessons per week
2014-04-27 13:31:13	laikas	ummm... lets say you are doing uralic linguistics 101... that has two lectures, one hour each, and one tutorial for one hour per week
2014-04-27 13:31:23	laikas	hat one unit would then count as theee hors per week
2014-04-27 13:31:28	laikas	three hours*
2014-04-27 13:31:43	laikas	lumi, there is no way you soend 40 hours in class per week
2014-04-27 13:31:43	Lumilintu	one hour? academical hour?
2014-04-27 13:31:50	Lumilintu	:D
2014-04-27 13:32:06	laikas	and if you dont know that off the top of your head, without having to calculate, then maybe university just isnt for you
2014-04-27 13:32:15	laikas	btw academic, not academical
2014-04-27 13:32:24	Lumilintu	:D
2014-04-27 13:32:31	Lumilintu	why should I know that off the top of my head?
2014-04-27 13:32:46	Lumilintu	I know I have 37 EAP and 12 courses this semester, but that's Estonian system
2014-04-27 13:33:05	laikas	do you spend, on average, eight hours per day in class?????
2014-04-27 13:33:18	Lumilintu	I have days where I got lectures from 8 to 8
2014-04-27 13:33:26	laikas	if you dont, then logically it follows you dont do 40 contact hours per week
2014-04-27 13:33:27	Lumilintu	when*
2014-04-27 13:33:30	Lumilintu	haha
2014-04-27 13:33:33	laikas	how many days, lumi?
2014-04-27 13:33:45	Lumilintu	well, I guess I don't get the 40 hours
2014-04-27 13:33:49	laikas	btw are you saying from 8am to 8pm you dont have a single break?
2014-04-27 13:33:53	Lumilintu	but my point being was
2014-04-27 13:34:00	laikas	of course you dont get 40 contact bours per week
2014-04-27 13:34:05	Lumilintu	that you say I have more free time then you do
2014-04-27 13:34:06	laikas	lumi ive fone to university
2014-04-27 13:34:10	laikas	gone*
2014-04-27 13:34:10	huf	wait, how come time spent studying outside uni doesnt count?
2014-04-27 13:34:19	laikas	both undergraduate and postgraduate
2014-04-27 13:34:22	huf	what twist of insanity have we falled through?
2014-04-27 13:34:25	laikas	i know how the sytem works
2014-04-27 13:34:27	Lumilintu	thank you, huf :D
2014-04-27 13:34:32	laikas	ive been where you are now
2014-04-27 13:34:42	huf	is laikas being a fucking asshole again? YES.
2014-04-27 13:34:46	huf	color me shocked.
2014-04-27 13:35:04	laikas	i cant believe you thought you had to "calculate" your contact hours, heh
2014-04-27 13:35:14	Lumilintu	the only thing I wanted to state is that I might have more "free" time, but that I need for my studies
2014-04-27 13:35:18	laikas	a if you were somehow even close to the 40 hours per week mark
2014-04-27 13:35:25	Lumilintu	I didn't think that, laikas
2014-04-27 13:35:34	Lumilintu	I didn't even say so
2014-04-27 13:35:41	laikas	*** Added huf!*@* to ignore
2014-04-27 13:35:52	laikas	well he lasted a whole week off my ignore list, heh
2014-04-27 13:35:54	huf	wasnt i already on ignore?
2014-04-27 13:35:55	Lumilintu	but I would have liked to show you that I'm not one of those people just having 4, 5 lectures per week
2014-04-27 13:36:04	Lumilintu	because then I could understand your argument
2014-04-27 13:36:07	huf	ah, good, at least i'm back on it
2014-04-27 13:36:16	laikas	he might have to wait until i clear it me t easter to see how long he manages toremain off ignore next year heh
2014-04-27 13:36:25	laikas	what a silly hungarian troll he is
2014-04-27 13:36:26	huf	you wont have a computer by then
2014-04-27 13:36:29	huf	i hope
2014-04-27 13:36:34	huf	unless you just like pretending to go amish
2014-04-27 13:36:40	huf	which is my actual theory
2014-04-27 13:36:43	laikas	the kind of person who is just incapable of disagreeing politely
2014-04-27 13:36:50	laikas	incredibly arrogant
2014-04-27 13:36:59	laikas	nothing he says is worth reading it seems
2014-04-27 13:37:14	Ericounet	laikas, we just had lunch ;)
2014-04-27 13:37:19	huf	1132 < laikas> and if you dont know that off the top of your head, without having to  calculate, then maybe university just isnt for you
2014-04-27 13:37:23	huf	^^^ that is polite
2014-04-27 13:37:31	laikas	i dont like spending my time reading the posts of such a poisonous righteous indiviual
2014-04-27 13:37:35	huf	an amazing world that laikas lives in.
2014-04-27 13:37:38	Lumilintu	:D
2014-04-27 13:37:45	laikas	he starts swearing and abusing you for daring to disagree
2014-04-27 13:37:47	laikas	heh
2014-04-27 13:37:48	Lumilintu	laikas, you can be arrogant from times to times, too
2014-04-27 13:37:53	laikas	to each their own
2014-04-27 13:37:59	laikas	not likethat, lumi
2014-04-27 13:38:07	Lumilintu	you just told me that university is not for me
2014-04-27 13:38:09	laikas	in my day thats not how you spoke o somebody
2014-04-27 13:38:16	huf	it's still your day you fuckwit
2014-04-27 13:38:22	laikas	we were taught manners back then
2014-04-27 13:38:34	laikas	we would never treat another person so rudely
2014-04-27 13:38:41	huf	haha.
2014-04-27 13:38:49	laikas	i we had nothing nice to say, we would say nothing
2014-04-27 13:38:59	laikas	maybe huf needs to practice saying nothing more often
2014-04-27 13:39:08	Lumilintu	and then people say drama is only for women
2014-04-27 13:39:12	Lumilintu	help
2014-04-27 13:39:14	laikas	whenever he says something, it tends to be venomous and laced with arrogance
2014-04-27 13:39:21	Ericounet	hi hi (lol, mdr)
2014-04-27 13:39:25	laikas	lumi, where did i say uni was not for you?
2014-04-27 13:39:30	huf	lol.
2014-04-27 13:39:31	Ericounet	Lumilintu, hi!
2014-04-27 13:39:36	huf	and now comes the backtracking and even more twisting.

2014-04-27 13:39:52	jubo2	kapsa-kartuli-krevetit kaljanhimo on ihan törkeä
2014-04-27 13:40:01	laikas	i said: if you actually had to calculate, because you thought you were even approaching 40 contact hours per week, then maybe its no- for you
2014-04-27 13:40:03	jubo2	ulkona on niin kaunis kaljotteluun sopivasää
2014-04-27 13:40:14	laikas	because i havent googled your course, and even i knew hat
2014-04-27 13:40:21	laikas	its just common sense really

2014-04-27 13:40:40	laikas	you can scroll up and reread exactly what i wrote if youre unsure lumilintu
2014-04-27 13:40:49	Ericounet	I'm happy that we don't have the sound ;)
2014-04-27 13:40:51	Lumilintu	laikas: the point was that I NEVER said my studies would be 40 hours per week
2014-04-27 13:40:55	laikas	at no point did i say: university isnt for you
2014-04-27 13:41:21	laikas	lumi, i asked you if your contact hours exceeded the 40 hour per week mark... and you said: id have to calculate
2014-04-27 13:41:28	laikas	as if there were even a chanc they would
2014-04-27 13:41:30	laikas	come on

2014-04-27 13:48:13	laikas	lumi, scroll up and try to find where i used any culgar language in reference to him? you won- find it
2014-04-27 13:48:29	laikas	but he has no problem slandering other people in a hideously vulgar manner
2014-04-27 13:48:29	huf	our original argument, which he tries to keep repainting as a mere disagreement was about him being a homophobe.
2014-04-27 13:48:34	huf	just to set the record straight.
2014-04-27 13:48:36	laikas	hes probably still ranting right now
2014-04-27 13:48:40	laikas	but i dont care
2014-04-27 13:48:54	laikas	itnorance is bliss
2014-04-27 13:48:56	huf	is vulgar language the only way to be rude?
2014-04-27 13:49:12	Lumilintu	laikas: on the other hand, I find it rather hard to have discussions with you, as you in fact do seem arrogant at times - no offence - and instead of waiting for your conversational partner to answer your arguments, you rather debate on your own and give them no time to actually answer to what you say
2014-04-27 13:49:13	laikas	he can continueto be abusive and negative all he likes, im happy so long as i dont have to read it
2014-04-27 13:49:29	jubo2	huf: surely one can be rude with fine expressions used with malicious intention
2014-04-27 13:49:37	laikas	lumi, ive been on irc since 1996 and thats just not how i wil stand being spoken to
2014-04-27 13:49:43	decem	<huf> wasnt i already on ignore?

2014-04-27 13:49:57	laikas	i go by the assumption that the person im speaking to can be 9 or 90
2014-04-27 13:50:10	laikas	thats not how people in my day spoke to 90 year olds
2014-04-27 13:50:21	laikas	decem please dont paste hufs text to me

2014-04-27 14:57:40	laikas	whenever i read my russian bible, and there is a heading at the start of a chapter, its in italics which makes it cursive

2014-04-27 14:58:29	laikas	its not  "native" script for me the way it is for tseno and alo
2014-04-27 14:58:40	laikas	they will always read it a billion times faster than me
2014-04-27 14:58:47	Lumilintu	:D
2014-04-27 14:59:03	Lumilintu	I just hope we will use the Latin alphabet somewhat
2014-04-27 14:59:15	laikas	dont fear cyrillic
2014-04-27 14:59:23	Lumilintu	I don't
2014-04-27 14:59:26	laikas	its probably theeadiest thing youll ever learn, heh
2014-04-27 14:59:32	Lumilintu	it's just that I'm taking a Tatar course
2014-04-27 14:59:37	laikas	other scripts are much more difficult in comparison
2014-04-27 14:59:44	Lumilintu	and they assume we know cyrillic
2014-04-27 14:59:51	laikas	i can read glagolitic, but only very, very spowly
2014-04-27 14:59:55	Lumilintu	don't know what exactly that means
2014-04-27 15:00:07	laikas	i obviously dont use it as much a i use cyrillic
2014-04-27 15:00:16	tseno	laikas: have seen my croatian glagolitic cursive handwriting ? :)
2014-04-27 15:00:29	laikas	i think tseno would kick my hu in glagolitic as well, he knows how to write in it, which ive never learned
2014-04-27 15:00:34	tseno	it's pretty :)
2014-04-27 15:00:35	laikas	no tseno, i havent

2014-04-27 15:00:58	tseno	i don't care :)
2014-04-27 15:01:07	laikas	lumi, you can learn all the cyrillic letters in 5 minutes and commit them to memory
2014-04-27 15:01:33	laikas	but it will probably take you about 3-4 hours to build up some fluency, ie reading at speed
2014-04-27 15:01:44	laikas	tseno, i didnt say you had t care
2014-04-27 15:01:52	laikas	youre welcometo not care, heh

2014-04-27 15:40:08	Lumilintu	laikas: well, let me put it this way, I can understand why people tend to dislike you. I've heard them saying that even before I met you and I always thought, no, he can't be as bad as they say, but after the first time we talked I actually understood them. the first impression of you I got was rather negative, to be honest. and it also bothered me, because I don't like to judge people by the first impression, but you sort of r
2014-04-27 15:40:10	Lumilintu	eally managed to annoy me that much that I had a negative picture of you from the beginning on.
2014-04-27 15:40:12	Lumilintu	but I can say it has improved a little, though I guess to become a person I'd actually like you'd have to change a lot more... and I'm not sure you'd manage, but on the other hand, there is no need to anyway. I guess right now I'm rather indifferent, though at times you are still a little annoying, to be honest.
2014-04-27 15:40:14	Lumilintu	but well, at least you accepted my criticism today, that was nice of you.

2014-04-27 15:41:48	minus273	hi all
2014-04-27 15:41:56	laikas	lumi. well i guess we can agree on something... i think we both understand why some people dislike me
2014-04-27 15:42:02	Lumilintu	:D
2014-04-27 15:42:11	laikas	btw lumi, it might shock you to learn that not all people do dislike me
2014-04-27 15:42:19	laikas	some get along with me quite well
2014-04-27 15:42:22	Lumilintu	it doesn't shock me
2014-04-27 15:42:26	Lumilintu	people are different
2014-04-27 15:42:33	laikas	in any eent i appreciate your honest, hat was vey bit of you
2014-04-27 15:42:51	laikas	and i imagine it wouldve been difficult to be so honest about such negative feelings
2014-04-27 15:43:00	Lumilintu	actually, no
2014-04-27 15:43:01	laikas	in any event, i have no intention of changing
2014-04-27 15:43:10	tseno	laikas: i think you're perfect just the way you are ... don't change
2014-04-27 15:43:11	Lumilintu	I'm a honest person
2014-04-27 15:43:12	tseno	ahahah
2014-04-27 15:43:18	laikas	if you have to change for people to like you... then are they really liking you for you?
2014-04-27 15:43:24	laikas	i dont think they are
2014-04-27 15:43:34	laikas	i think theyre liking pseudo-you
2014-04-27 15:43:34	Lumilintu	true ;)
2014-04-27 15:43:38	laikas	or some fake variant
2014-04-27 15:43:38	Lumilintu	that's what I said, no need to
2014-04-27 15:43:52	laikas	id much rather just be myself... the truth comes out soner o later
2014-04-27 15:43:59	laikas	besides, i dont know how to be anyone else
2014-04-27 15:44:08	Lumilintu	but taking into account their criticism when it has a reason would be a nice gesture
2014-04-27 15:44:25	laikas	ive never claimed to be perfect, lumi

2014-04-27 15:45:25	laikas	and im at the stage of my life where i realise theres no point trying to impress people...
2014-04-27 15:45:34	laikas	people will either like you or hate you
2014-04-27 15:45:49	laikas	you cant please all of the people all of the time, so theres no point even trying
2014-04-27 15:46:19	laikas	just be yourself, live life, and enjoy good conversations with those that you find you get along with
2014-04-27 15:46:28	laikas	as for the rest... stuff em
2014-04-27 15:46:40	laikas	you do your -hing, they can do theirs
2014-04-27 15:47:00	laikas	id never expect other people to change for me, and i likewise will nkt change for others
2014-04-27 15:47:27	laikas	li, my opinions of you at first were a little negative, i hought some o he things you did, you did for attention
2014-04-27 15:47:45	laikas	but ive come to realise that i misjudged you and couldnt have been more wrong
2014-04-27 15:47:51	Lumilintu	aw :)
2014-04-27 15:48:04	laikas	youre a freat new addition to the channel, highly intelligent, and a fenerally caring person

2014-04-27 15:48:20	tseno	the assumptions you make tell a lot about you laikas :)
2014-04-27 15:48:38	laikas	w will always disagree on core topics, but that doesnt bother me... i can disagree with people and not think less of them
2014-04-27 15:48:48	laikas	unlike huf, who has a very hard time doing -hat
2014-04-27 15:49:08	Lumilintu	well
2014-04-27 15:49:12	laikas	if you dare disagree with him, you go straight on his hate list, and he will throw abuse at you until the day you die
2014-04-27 15:49:18	laikas	tseno, im sure you can
2014-04-27 15:49:22	tseno	i think huf is the most reasonable person who types at this tag
2014-04-27 15:49:39	laikas	li, the difference between you and me is that... first impressions dont mean a thing to me
2014-04-27 15:49:56	laikas	i dont hold grudges, and all of our tiffs are essentially forgotten
2014-04-27 15:50:07	Lumilintu	I also have to say that I'm not the most emotional person. so when the first time we talked you already managed to annoy me, it left quite an impression on me, as that usually doesn't happen to me that easily. so you sort of have a talent, haha
2014-04-27 15:50:10	laikas	but for women its a bi different, they cant just forget the past
2014-04-27 15:50:24	laikas	so while i can wile the slate clean, -hat will be harder for you to do
2014-04-27 15:50:44	laikas	but i can accept that, hh, its the price i pay for rubbing you the wrong way to begin with
2014-04-27 15:50:47	tseno	yet another assumption :)
2014-04-27 15:51:00	Lumilintu	also, there are only few people I like
2014-04-27 15:51:16	laikas	im the opposite
2014-04-27 15:51:34	Lumilintu	even fewer in the "virtual" world
2014-04-27 15:51:38	laikas	i assume everyone is a good person, and that i will like each person... until i have a reason not to
2014-04-27 15:51:45	Lumilintu	to most, I have indifferent feelings
2014-04-27 15:52:03	laikas	look at tseno, given our tumultuous history we really should never soeak to each other ever again
2014-04-27 15:52:25	laikas	but even though he is so good at pissing me off, i cant help but give him the benefit of the doubt kver and over again
2014-04-27 15:52:34	laikas	i dont think hes a bad person
2014-04-27 15:52:55	laikas	i think we are polar opposites, and find it very difficult to understand one another
2014-04-27 15:53:10	laikas	but that doesnt make either one of us bad... just different
2014-04-27 15:53:20	laikas	if psy could see me typing now hed be so impressed
2014-04-27 15:53:33	laikas	my phone tyling has come a long way in just one week
2014-04-27 15:53:44	laikas	its still slow, but my accuracy is so much better
2014-04-27 15:53:58	tseno	not really :)

2014-04-27 19:16:02	jubo2	I tell the kids that best frequency to smoke ganja is every other evening
2014-04-27 19:16:22	jubo2	that keeps the toles low and you actually enjoy it
2014-04-27 19:16:36	yabba	every other evening sounds rather often to me
2014-04-27 19:16:52	jubo2	yabba: ya.. then again you don't prlly chronic
2014-04-27 19:17:09	yabba	ya
2014-04-27 19:17:16	jubo2	I chronic. I'm about huff-puff like the hobbits are about breakfasts
2014-04-27 19:17:18	yabba	but i guess it does depend on the person
2014-04-27 19:18:11	yabba	every other evening is often enough that it can at least potentially suck you into some sorta vicious circle of drug use as well
2014-04-27 19:20:43	decem	Leopejo: go
2014-04-27 19:21:02	decem	jubo2: are you high
2014-04-27 19:21:04	decem	now
2014-04-27 19:21:07	Leopejo	now I am listening to the performers

2014-04-27 19:24:24	jubo2	decem: is the roof high? are the walls good if the roof doesn't fall?
2014-04-27 19:24:51	yabba	you will probably be fine
2014-04-27 19:25:12	jubo2	decem: http://mediagoblin.org

2014-04-27 19:25:46	jubo2	it will eat and burp and digest and poop youtube, flickr, soundcloud etc.
2014-04-27 19:26:09	yabba	yeah right
2014-04-27 19:26:11	jubo2	I am thinking of running an instance
2014-04-27 19:26:26	yabba	just like linux did swallow up windows
2014-04-27 19:26:51	jubo2	The server in the lower lands uses 2GB for Debian7 OS and #Diapsora*
2014-04-27 19:26:57	yabba	why should i try to use my own server instead of using a big company
2014-04-27 19:27:03	jubo2	so there is 2 GB of spare RAM
2014-04-27 19:27:18	jubo2	and with 2 cores there is no lack of processing powa punch
2014-04-27 19:27:35	jubo2	and the disk is 150GB in the entry level package
2014-04-27 19:27:50	yabba	i take this as confirmation that he is high
2014-04-27 19:27:53	jubo2	so why not host 100GB of MediaGoblin informationz
2014-04-27 19:28:58	jubo2	Disk IO, network, electricity, cooling and free daily backups are few tens of euroz
2014-04-27 19:29:13	jubo2	per month
2014-04-27 19:30:30	yabba	so youre not even doing it on your own but still relying on service by another company
2014-04-27 19:30:38	jubo2	incl the 2 cores, 4GB and 150GB
2014-04-27 19:30:51	yabba	that in your case is small and offers no security

2014-04-27 19:33:33	jubo2	yabba: "Games" is the only reason why'd one want a native copy Windows instead of running it in Virtualized sandbox
2014-04-27 19:33:42	Leopejo	not true jubo2
2014-04-27 19:34:15	jubo2	'k 'k.. let me rephrase..
2014-04-27 19:34:26	yabba	i dont know
2014-04-27 19:34:54	jubo2	"'Gaming' is the only reason why'd you want to run a Windows on HW rather then virtualization box
2014-04-27 19:35:01	Leopejo	not true
2014-04-27 19:35:02	yabba	i dont like windows much but its a good thing for ordinary people who no nothing about how to administrate a system
2014-04-27 19:35:42	yabba	although OSs like android are preferable for the latter
2014-04-27 19:36:30	Leopejo	hmm youtube didn't really convince me

2014-04-27 20:06:55	Leopejo	a mix of kasza (una specie di cereali), blood and interiors of pig
2014-04-27 20:07:06	psydroid	I've been around somewhat
2014-04-27 20:07:07	psydroid	hi Soassae

2014-04-27 20:07:22	Soassae	Leopejo: una specie di sanguinaccio arricchito?
2014-04-27 20:07:37	Leopejo	ha un gusto piuttosto specifico
2014-04-27 20:07:38	botanista	And that's very different from susage?
2014-04-27 20:07:41	Leopejo	simile a quello tedesco
2014-04-27 20:07:58	uxfi	hi
2014-04-27 20:08:14	Leopejo	Grützwurst in Germany
2014-04-27 20:08:19	Leopejo	but no
2014-04-27 20:08:23	Leopejo	it's not a wurst
2014-04-27 20:08:46	Leopejo	it's not packed that is, just free to flow on your plate
2014-04-27 20:09:28	Leopejo	anyway I avoid all things like that, be they Polish, Italian or Finnish "blood crepes"
2014-04-27 20:10:06	yabba	even our good grützwurst ?
2014-04-27 20:10:26	jubo2	"Zwei Maß, Currywürst une gekucht Sauerkraut, Bitte, Sonne de Deine Mutter."
2014-04-27 20:10:53	Leopejo	sorry yabba

2014-04-27 20:11:30	yabba	milanese ?

2014-04-27 20:12:07	yabba	aber was schon, wir sind doch nur schwapmer !
2014-04-27 20:12:24	jubo2	Leopejo: In Finlan Jägerschnitzel is like pork schitzel with mushroom sauce
2014-04-27 20:12:28	yabba	ein bisschen grütze ein bisschen schwamper, wunderbar

2014-04-27 20:12:53	yabba	haha lumi
2014-04-27 20:12:57	Lumilintu	Bretzeln, no?
2014-04-27 20:13:01	Leopejo	you should get to Hungary instead
2014-04-27 20:13:12	Lumilintu	actually, Brezeln
2014-04-27 20:13:14	Leopejo	especially after I convinced people it's not worth to go there
2014-04-27 20:13:24	Lumilintu	:o
2014-04-27 20:13:29	Lumilintu	it isn't?
2014-04-27 20:13:32	Lumilintu	they have wine there
2014-04-27 20:13:33	jubo2	I can get real nice bretzeln at da Liidld
2014-04-27 20:13:48	Leopejo	I don't know, but I didn't want to go to Budapest and Wien next weekend
2014-04-27 20:14:10	yabba	why not, dont feel like resuscitating the austohungarian empire
2014-04-27 20:14:30	Leopejo	mainly because it would be a camper travel
2014-04-27 20:14:34	Leopejo	which I am not a fan of.
2014-04-27 20:15:25	yabba	camping folk are often discriminated against in hungary also i hear
2014-04-27 20:15:47	Leopejo	campervan/motorhome/recreational vehicle for anglophones
2014-04-27 20:21:39	yabba	so chat room
2014-04-27 20:21:40	jubo2	Leopejo: I love sealiha svampiga, basically same thing but in Eesti so half cheaper
2014-04-27 20:21:50	yabba	what is better nescafe dolce gusto or nespresso
2014-04-27 20:22:06	Leopejo	neither
2014-04-27 20:22:15	yabba	i want capsule coffee
2014-04-27 20:22:16	jubo2	yabba: they're both stit coz Nestlé kills babies for profits
2014-04-27 20:22:20	yabba	i dont drink much coffee
2014-04-27 20:22:23	Leopejo	capsule coffee is a scam
2014-04-27 20:22:28	yabba	yeah i know
2014-04-27 20:22:32	yabba	but i drink so little
2014-04-27 20:22:35	yabba	its good for me
2014-04-27 20:22:43	yabba	because it does taste good !
2014-04-27 20:22:45	Leopejo	coffee is so expensive even if you drink so little
2014-04-27 20:22:53	Leopejo	and capsule is certainly not better
2014-04-27 20:23:03	jubo2	Leopejo: capsule coffee is for people lazy enough that they cannot clean their own espresso grinds
2014-04-27 20:23:26	botanista	I agree with Leopejo
2014-04-27 20:23:37	botanista	Plastic coffee is horrible
2014-04-27 20:23:41	yabba	not better ?

2014-04-27 20:26:09	yabba	and they do make very nice coffee
2014-04-27 20:26:19	yabba	to my liking
2014-04-27 20:26:23	jubo2	I mean lazy bastards that they can't cook an espresso in their presso cooker
2014-04-27 20:26:27	Leopejo	that is a moka
2014-04-27 20:26:37	Leopejo	and I don't think you can use a capsule with the moka
2014-04-27 20:26:37	yabba	isnt mokka turkish coffee
2014-04-27 20:26:44	Covered	:O
2014-04-27 20:26:47	jubo2	Leopejo: fi."moka" == en."failure, fumble-up"
2014-04-27 20:26:59	yabba	boti you mean true coffee bones shredded there in the shop?
2014-04-27 20:27:07	botanista	No, mocca comes from Yemen
2014-04-27 20:27:08	Leopejo	what you have is called a moka machine in Italian
2014-04-27 20:27:19	yabba	okay
2014-04-27 20:27:20	Leopejo	jubo2, I know, I am Finn :P
2014-04-27 20:27:26	botanista	Yes yabba
2014-04-27 20:27:29	jubo2	He're your grind of bones..
2014-04-27 20:27:29	yabba	and what other machines do you have leo
2014-04-27 20:27:58	Leopejo	I have that and a home espresso machine
2014-04-27 20:27:58	yabba	boti but these coffee capsule machines they make the coffee so soft :D

2014-04-27 20:28:21	Leopejo	I use both grinded coffee (only Italian unfortunately and expensive as hell in Poland) and coffee in grains
2014-04-27 20:28:24	Leopejo	I have a small coffee grinder.
2014-04-27 20:28:46	botanista	yabba: but you'll have to buy the machine first
2014-04-27 20:28:48	Leopejo	yabba, first of all learn to make a good coffee with your moka :D
2014-04-27 20:28:56	yabba	:D
2014-04-27 20:29:00	Leopejo	then if you want buy an espresso machine, but no capsules please

2014-04-27 20:29:16	yabba	i also like it but as i said im not a big coffee drinker i mean i like it but i dont drink much
2014-04-27 20:29:24	botanista	I thought Leopejo might like this bag
2014-04-27 20:29:36	botanista	It's sitting here staring at me
2014-04-27 20:29:38	yabba	leopejo so the main argument against the capsules is that they are made from plastic ?
2014-04-27 20:29:59	Leopejo	no, that they are a scam
2014-04-27 20:30:01	yabba	haha boti
2014-04-27 20:30:06	yabba	why?
2014-04-27 20:30:12	Leopejo	they offer nothing that normal grinded coffee offers
2014-04-27 20:30:17	yabba	only because they are so expensive if you drink a lot
2014-04-27 20:30:17	botanista	Quality
2014-04-27 20:30:22	Leopejo	but at five times the price
2014-04-27 20:30:23	botanista	No quality
2014-04-27 20:30:25	yabba	but they are popular
2014-04-27 20:30:31	Leopejo	because people are lazy
2014-04-27 20:30:41	botanista	And because it's cool to have them
2014-04-27 20:30:45	Leopejo	and also because of their aggressive campaigning
2014-04-27 20:30:53	Leopejo	offering a machine almost for free
2014-04-27 20:30:59	Leopejo	but you have to use their capsules
2014-04-27 20:31:10	yabba	yeah i just saw anothr ad on tv when i brought the subject up here :D
2014-04-27 20:31:36	Leopejo	nice bag botanista , where does it come from?
2014-04-27 20:31:46	botanista	Then better not see the Goeorge Cloony ad, you'd go buy the machine
2014-04-27 20:32:04	yabba	:D
2014-04-27 20:32:11	botanista	Leopejo: the chocolate company, a cafe/chocolate shop in Heidelberg
2014-04-27 20:32:41	botanista	You choose from hundreds of chocolate spoons, they serve you a cup of hot milk or coffee for you to dip them in

2014-04-27 20:54:01	botanista	Hi uxfi
2014-04-27 20:54:06	Leopejo	it's worse when it always shows 100 %, like my Garmin did a few weeks ago

2014-04-27 22:19:14	Leopejo	in 99 % of public saunas in Finland there are separate saunas for guys and for girls, PetrusB

2014-04-27 22:19:28	PetrusB	Leopejo: sadly
2014-04-27 22:19:33	Leopejo	and usually at private parties and such they also go separate
2014-04-27 22:19:34	Lumilintu	jubo2, Leopejo: when I spent juhannus in Finland last year, no one went to sauna naked
2014-04-27 22:19:44	Leopejo	because you were there, Lumilintu .
2014-04-27 22:19:48	Lumilintu	no
2014-04-27 22:20:04	Lumilintu	when I asked, they said I could go there naked, they wouldn't mind, but they just don't
2014-04-27 22:20:14	PetrusB	Leopejo: Hmm
2014-04-27 22:20:24	Leopejo	but if there were no Lumilintu and it were only guys, they would go naked, Lumilintu
2014-04-27 22:20:41	PetrusB	Leopejo: My professor told me that when he studied in Finland, he was in the sauna with a professor and his wife, maybe he was lying, that sucker
2014-04-27 22:20:54	Leopejo	possible, PetrusB , nothing strange in that
2014-04-27 22:21:02	PetrusB	I don't want to be naked among other men, Leopejo, it's against my moral laws
2014-04-27 22:21:20	PetrusB	actually not against anything
2014-04-27 22:21:22	PetrusB	but it sounds scary
2014-04-27 22:21:32	Leopejo	your "moral laws" :D

2014-04-27 22:21:55	PetrusB	being in a sauna with other 5 naked men is the worst situation I can ever imagine
2014-04-27 22:22:04	Leopejo	PetrusB, sauna is the most asexual place ever.
2014-04-27 22:22:13	PetrusB	I don't shower in the gym
2014-04-27 22:22:38	PetrusB	hmm
2014-04-27 22:22:41	Leopejo	and no team sport ever?
2014-04-27 22:22:46	PetrusB	but where I studied
2014-04-27 22:22:52	PetrusB	there were showers separated by walls
2014-04-27 22:22:56	PetrusB	and a door
2014-04-27 22:23:32	PetrusB	but usually Brazilians don't seem to have the habit of showering at public places, I dunno

2014-04-27 22:23:45	PetrusB	I went home and then showered there

2014-04-27 22:24:17	PetrusB	I'd be scared as well, Leopejo
2014-04-27 22:24:21	PetrusB	and very uncomfortable

2014-04-27 22:24:27	PetrusB	how can you admit something like that?
2014-04-27 22:24:37	Leopejo	PetrusB, try it first, then judge
2014-04-27 22:24:55	Leopejo	nudity by itself is not immoral nor sexual
2014-04-27 22:25:00	PetrusB	Leopejo: Impossible, I'm from the culture that most sexualizes bodies in the world, I fear
2014-04-27 22:25:09	PetrusB	if you're born in finland
2014-04-27 22:25:10	Leopejo	it's the Catholic countries that demonize nudity, yes
2014-04-27 22:25:11	PetrusB	maybe

2014-04-27 22:27:15	Leopejo	what's the difference

2014-05-02 20:11:40	tricours	one of my exes did that, on my birthday
2014-05-02 20:11:40	DissidentRage	I would ask to meet in public
2014-05-02 20:11:43	soldeace	I wouldn't invite myself over to anyone's place
2014-05-02 20:12:17	soldeace	although it depends on several factors
2014-05-02 20:12:27	botanista	And if she says she'd rather meet you outside, would you call her unfriendly?

2014-05-02 20:12:43	soldeace	not at all
2014-05-02 20:12:45	tricours	sounds like a possible psycho
2014-05-02 20:12:49	tricours	avoid
2014-05-02 20:13:01	DissidentRage	yeah that's pretty much the kind of rep I'd try to avoid :P
2014-05-02 20:13:07	Covered	hey tricours  :) I've finally sent my CV to international translation agencies
2014-05-02 20:13:16	botanista	One more, would you call her unfriendly and still want to force her into meeting you?
2014-05-02 20:13:20	DissidentRage	a guy should establish that he's not a freak
2014-05-02 20:13:37	tricours	Covered: ah! good luck then!
2014-05-02 20:13:40	botanista	:P

2014-05-02 20:13:54	botanista	Good luck Covered

2014-05-02 20:14:21	botanista	Not a friend, soldeace
2014-05-02 20:14:31	soldeace	neither an 'internet friend'?
2014-05-02 20:14:41	DissidentRage	sounds like a crazy OkC stalker
2014-05-02 20:15:00	botanista	Someone I met at a language exchange event who claimed needing help in arabic so I made the mistake of exchanging contacts
2014-05-02 20:15:13	botanista	Yup he's my one and only stalker
2014-05-02 20:15:28	soldeace	well
2014-05-02 20:15:40	Lomishvili	So are you never going to help anyone with arabic ever again
2014-05-02 20:15:46	DissidentRage	lol
2014-05-02 20:16:00	botanista	After talking on facebook or whatsapp for the first time, help in arabic became help in german, and links were not appreciated, only meeting in person
2014-05-02 20:16:20	botanista	Lomishvili: lol maybe I should consider that
2014-05-02 20:16:25	soldeace	our opinions don't necessarily reflect the truth, since #learnanylanguage's male population doesn't necessarily reflects the average male's behavior :P
2014-05-02 20:16:32	soldeace	and there are cultural differences
2014-05-02 20:16:47	DissidentRage	so he's just using the language thing as a wedge to get close to you
2014-05-02 20:16:47	soldeace	anyway, if you're really looking into meeting this guy, why don't you take a friend with you?
2014-05-02 20:17:08	tricours	I wouldn't meet with him based on what botanista has said about his attitude
2014-05-02 20:17:09	botanista	I'm not.. I'm already creeped out
2014-05-02 20:17:22	botanista	So it's not just me, thank you

2014-05-02 20:22:49	botanista	And thought you'd say at least 5 cats
2014-05-02 20:23:17	tricours	I was talking about wanting a dog, and was told that I could definitely NOT have any more cats
2014-05-02 20:23:19	tricours	by my friends
2014-05-02 20:23:25	tricours	I don't understand why they get to decide this

2014-05-02 20:24:55	Lomishvili	and take a similar picture so that can dawww at it
2014-05-02 20:25:00	tricours	Tom usually says that he knows I'll like a dog if he finds it ugly, and it's mostly true

2014-05-05 22:40:32	Leopejo	less than 2 euro

2014-05-05 22:45:46	jubo2	..?
2014-05-05 22:45:50	tseno	i saw boxes of 3l for 5 euro
2014-05-05 22:46:04	jubo2	2€ / bottle sounds too cheap to be passable wine
2014-05-05 22:46:42	jubo2	I know from Paris that the 2-3l jugs for 4€ of Vin du Table are bordering on non-drinkable
2014-05-05 22:46:44	Leopejo	it's a Grand Vin de Bordeaux
2014-05-05 22:47:03	jubo2	which is a far cry of the maliciousness levels of vrai rhympertine française..

2014-05-05 22:47:44	jubo2	which is straight out toxic
2014-05-05 22:47:57	Leopejo	soon I'll find out
2014-05-05 22:48:09	Leopejo	in Lidl Bordeaux usually starts at near 20 zl
2014-05-05 22:48:40	Leopejo	they were selling at the same price also 2005, 2006 wines
2014-05-05 22:48:47	Leopejo	which definitely are not drinkable anymore.
2014-05-05 22:48:55	jubo2	Leopejo: don't be silly
2014-05-05 22:49:04	jubo2	a nice red wine will develop when aged

2014-05-05 22:49:20	Leopejo	AND on how it is conserved
2014-05-05 22:49:28	Leopejo	and Lidl is not the best place from this point of view.
2014-05-05 22:49:36	jubo2	how about corked bottles..? would that do ..?
2014-05-05 22:49:46	Leopejo	Sure, a Brunello should resist those years, but cheap French wines?

2014-05-09 17:57:55	Timoteo	the heartbleed bug was able to be found with a simple analysis via valgrind.. which makes it guaranteed that some people knew of it.. and it opens the question, why it wasn't spotted by people earlier for fixing
2014-05-09 17:58:01	yabba	nonmais un chanteur italien qui a une belle voix ca t esuffit
2014-05-09 17:58:16	yabba	et une chanteuse magnifique albanaise :P
2014-05-09 17:58:50	tseno	indeed Timoteo ... i think it is a conspiracy
2014-05-09 17:58:55	Timoteo	but then again, the same people that supposed to find this bug were supposed not to disable the mechanism to prevent these kind of exploits of occuring (there was a mechanism, that they disabled for performance reasons.. with it in place the bug would not have occurred, but instead openssl would have crashed.. which would be a noticable thing)
2014-05-09 17:59:28	Timoteo	the conclusion is not a conspiracy, but an incompetency, tseno
2014-05-09 17:59:49	olti	if it's a conspiracy, that's fine

2014-05-09 18:02:43	Timoteo	olti: sure the nsa spies on us.. they probably knew about it for a long time (after all that's in their job description).. but common.. its not like we have to make it easy on them :P "they spy on us anyway" is the wrong attitude
2014-05-09 18:03:19	Timoteo	because it's the attitude that they use to argue for their behavior "the population supports us" :p
2014-05-09 18:03:20	zippo^	ok, has nsa hacked heartbleed, Timoteo /
2014-05-09 18:03:21	zippo^	?

2014-05-09 18:03:30	olti	*most
2014-05-09 18:04:34	Timoteo	zippo^: officially we don't know.. although bloomberg claims they did... but from what we know, it would be highly unlikly that they didn't... they spend too many money on finding these kind of things, as that I believe for a second they missed this one
2014-05-09 18:04:36	olti	still we have to rely on such tools Timoteo
2014-05-09 18:05:23	olti	there's no perfect tool

2014-05-09 18:08:30	Timoteo	even though their possibilities are quite scary.. in fact.. heartbleedbug servers technicly have to exchange their hardware now :P the nsa has software to flash the bios and host-specific parts of harddisks that reinstall governmental trojan horses back onto the server if you reinstall it just softwarewise
2014-05-09 18:08:58	Timoteo	they value it at a cost of 0$, meaning they will or have automated that part large scale

2014-05-09 18:48:38	monsieurp	"Multivariate analysis indicates that economic elites and organised groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on US government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence."
2014-05-09 18:48:56	monsieurp	"When a majority of citizens disagrees with economic elites and/or with organised interests, they generally lose. Moreover, because of the strong status quo bias built into the US political system, even when fairly large majorities of Americans favour policy change, they generally do not get it."
2014-05-09 18:49:07	cntrational	sérieusement, la politique? J'm'en câlisse comme de l'an 40
2014-05-09 18:49:13	decem	Main point: "The World is dividing into two blocs - the Plutonomy and the rest. The U.S.,
2014-05-09 18:49:13	decem	UK, and Canada are the key Plutonomies - economies powered by the wealthy.
2014-05-09 18:49:13	decem	Continental Europe (ex-Italy) and Japan are in the egalitarian bloc."
2014-05-09 18:49:21	monsieurp	Lastly
2014-05-09 18:49:26	monsieurp	"Americans do enjoy many features central to democratic governance, such as regular elections, freedom of speech and association and a widespread (if still contested) franchise. But we believe that if policymaking is dominated by powerful business organisations and a small number of affluent Americans, then America's claims to being a democratic society are seriously threatened."
2014-05-09 18:49:59	Timoteo	there's a much scarier yet possible scenario... you know.. there's an organ in the us government that, as we know for pretty certain, knows exactly what kind of porn every us senator is watching and what else they might be blackmailable about...
2014-05-09 18:50:11	decem	they're happy to write that though, monsieurp, they being the rich plutocracy of course

2014-05-09 18:54:39	decem	monsieurp: the thing that supports the idea of the US, UK and Canada being primary plutonomies is the fact that the biggest capitalists themselves (i.e. citigroup) is admitting it themselves, it's not just the opposition claiming that neo-capitalism has got out of control, it is the system itself declaring that it has beaten democracy and all notions of social equality
2014-05-09 18:55:20	DissidentRage	regardless of capitalist claims otherwise, if someone calls them plutarchs and they act like plutarchs, they are
2014-05-09 18:55:36	DissidentRage	it's not a matter of opinion
2014-05-09 18:55:36	tseno	Timoteo: it's a property of the structure of the political system... the concentration of power will lead to even higher concentration of power and power corrupts
2014-05-09 18:56:27	Timoteo	well.. I think the source of the problem is a cultural attitude.. the "end justifies the means" attitude has a major flaw.. it doesn't prevent the actor to change the end somewhere along the way and keep the means
2014-05-09 18:57:08	Leopejo	too much politics, see you

2014-05-09 19:08:36	DissidentRage	as for working for a start-up vs a corporation, it depends
2014-05-09 19:09:10	DissidentRage	if you're working for some jackhole that will run the company into the ground because he likes nice things (as per most of my experiences with small businesses)

2014-05-09 19:11:18	monsieurp	the thing is.. when a start-up gets VC-backed and/or VC-financed, it basically becomes like a small corp. because the business is then somewhat "under control"
2014-05-09 19:11:32	DissidentRage	basically VC's intent is to implement bad ideas so they can sell off your company for parts

2014-05-09 19:27:33	tseno	yeah... i've heard about that ...

2014-05-09 19:28:51	tseno	DissidentRage: last year i went to give blood last year... and bulgarian law gives me 2 days of payed lieve for giving blood ... after the two days when i went to the office they held a meeting with me and two bosses and they almost fired me

2014-05-09 20:12:08	Timoteo	du kannst auch project "über" die project anlegen, dann erstellt er dir die .project files und alles nötige um es java project zu mahen
2014-05-09 20:12:46	Timoteo	.project files händisch anlegen ginge natürlich auch, wenn du deren content richtig anlegst
2014-05-09 20:13:23	colonolGron	die sehen ziemlich minimal aus diese .project files, sieht einfacher aus da einfach immer nur den projekt namen zu ändern als 100 klicks zu machen und es als neues projekt anlegen und dann dateien zu importieren

2014-05-10 11:55:04	monsieurp	don't tell me off
2014-05-10 11:55:19	Leopejo	I have found usually it is better to just read your pdf than to convert it to mobi
2014-05-10 11:55:36	Leopejo	if the font isn't too small.
2014-05-10 11:55:47	huf	i tend to convert since pdf reflow is usually nonexistent or shitty
2014-05-10 11:56:14	huf	and non-reflowed a4 pages on a kindle are really awful
2014-05-10 11:56:24	huf	1px fonts and you have to scroll to see the right margin :)
2014-05-10 11:57:00	huf	but that's what you get when you use a format that was designed for printing
2014-05-10 11:57:24	huf	no reflow needed there

2014-05-11 12:05:58	psytab	I've been listening to Norwegian folk music all morning, it sounds quite familiar and reminds me of Indian and sometimes also Turkic musical traditions from the East (such as the throat singing, I didn't expect to hear that in Norway)
2014-05-11 12:06:10	psytab	bonjour tseno :)

2014-05-11 12:18:27	cJIaB	I sometimes do too, tseno, I'd go there before this place Leopejo promotes fosho
2014-05-11 12:22:52	tseno	see Leopejo ... you're a bad destination promoter
2014-05-11 12:23:14	Leopejo	I am no destination promoter
2014-05-11 12:23:27	Leopejo	and Baku is a strange city but fascinating
2014-05-11 12:23:49	tseno	the oil fields of baku
2014-05-11 12:23:54	psytab	have you been there, Leopejo?
2014-05-11 12:24:09	Leopejo	no, psytab . I am watching a meaningless cycling race there, psytab
2014-05-11 12:24:22	Leopejo	which is shown on Eurosport live.
2014-05-11 12:24:37	Leopejo	I wonder how much they paid Eurosport to show it.
2014-05-11 12:24:55	psytab	I would love to go there myself, Tehran is only just 4 hours away by bus/train from there
2014-05-11 12:25:00	tseno	i watched a french documentary about baku with yabba the other week
2014-05-11 12:25:17	colonolGron	yabba da hood?
2014-05-11 12:25:25	Leopejo	Such modern buildings but also such "old" buildings
2014-05-11 12:25:42	tseno	the iranian part is up on a hill
2014-05-11 12:25:51	tseno	and there is the flame building which is modern :)
2014-05-11 12:26:09	psytab	is it on youtube, tseno?
2014-05-11 12:26:43	Leopejo	the TV director/filmographer shows the city more than the cycliing.... and rightly so
2014-05-11 12:27:10	tseno	psytab: i thinks it's not :\
2014-05-11 12:27:26	psytab	there are Wizzair flights to Baku
2014-05-11 12:28:39	psytab	tseno, do you know the name of the documentary?

2014-05-11 12:30:25	colonolGron	hello you
2014-05-11 12:31:56	Leopejo	now I know why colonolGron moved to Switzerland
2014-05-11 12:32:19	Leopejo	to more freely use illegal file sharing services
2014-05-11 12:32:28	Leopejo	and to watch more youtube videos.
2014-05-11 12:32:32	colonolGron	lol :P
2014-05-11 12:32:52	colonolGron	uhh! you are right! i have no problems on youtube anymore! i didnt even realize!
2014-05-11 12:33:13	colonolGron	but i also have one big disadvantage: they show advertisement in frensh on youtube :'(
2014-05-11 12:33:48	Leopejo	:D
2014-05-11 12:34:00	psytab	colonolGron, did you move to Switzerland permanently?
2014-05-11 12:34:19	colonolGron	well if permanently != forever, yes
2014-05-11 12:34:33	Leopejo	as permanently as psytab moved to Poland
2014-05-11 12:34:41	psytab	you got a job and all there?
2014-05-11 12:34:42	colonolGron	then yes
2014-05-11 12:34:46	colonolGron	no psytab
2014-05-11 12:34:55	colonolGron	i have a job in germany, still. and still go to uni there
2014-05-11 12:35:46	psytab	I had been wondering about going to live and work in Switzerland before
2014-05-11 12:36:10	tseno	my ennemies are defeated yours lie dormant
2014-05-11 12:36:19	colonolGron	now that i am here, i realize many differences to germany, which i was never so aware of
2014-05-11 12:36:30	psytab	and I guess language wouldn't be much of a problem for me
2014-05-11 12:36:40	psytab	like what?
2014-05-11 12:36:58	colonolGron	psytab: i know some germans which have problems understanding people here. but of course that depends
2014-05-11 12:37:50	psytab	colonolGron, Swiss German sounds like Dutch but isn't, I could adjust to it with time
2014-05-11 12:38:48	colonolGron	mostly in customs, people are different in a certain way. also how the state is organaized. if you have a kid and want to send it to the Kindergarten(more Kita, but i dont know the english word). it costs 400 per month in germany. it costs 100 per day in switzerland o_O
2014-05-11 12:39:15	psytab	wow
2014-05-11 12:39:19	colonolGron	psytab: are you aware that "swiss german" has sooo many dialects, and some sound _really_ different?
2014-05-11 12:39:33	Leopejo	400 euro a month? :O
2014-05-11 12:39:44	Leopejo	that's like the average pay in Poland
2014-05-11 12:39:59	colonolGron	in relation in germany its okay
2014-05-11 12:40:25	psytab	colonolGron, I know a bit because of what nighmi told me, but all I've ever visited is Basel so I'll have to see for myself
2014-05-11 12:40:52	colonolGron	but 100 per day is even high in switzerland. most people only send kids to Kita one or two days per week. because of this its more traditional here than in germany: wifes stay at home with the kids
2014-05-11 12:41:04	tseno	Leopejo: don't send your children to germany .. not only will they take your money but they will teach the poor kids GERMAN
2014-05-11 12:41:25	psytab	and what about the prices of food and housing?
2014-05-11 12:41:29	colonolGron	yes, Basel is good to understand. and i also think you could adjust well in general. but there are some villages which are really hard to undrestand
2014-05-11 12:41:44	colonolGron	psytab: very high
2014-05-11 12:41:48	colonolGron	living costs are high
2014-05-11 12:42:10	colonolGron	but my costs for housing are less than in Konstanz, they are really high there
2014-05-11 12:42:12	fenris_kcf	did someone just compare Swiss German with Dutch?
2014-05-11 12:42:20	psytab	Norway is insanely expensive, prices are 4 times as high as in Poland
2014-05-11 12:42:37	Leopejo	no intention of sending my kids to Germany, tseno, don't worry
2014-05-11 12:42:48	colonolGron	more so: which kids? :P
2014-05-11 12:42:55	Leopejo	I mean, I could marry colonolGron , but then I could not have kids
2014-05-11 12:43:03	colonolGron	indeed
2014-05-11 12:43:15	tseno	boys can't have babies :\
2014-05-11 12:43:31	Leopejo	they can but they need help

2014-05-11 12:49:54	psytab	hallo monsieurp
2014-05-11 12:50:08	monsieurp	Swiss German doesnt make sense
2014-05-11 12:50:35	colonolGron	psytab: but the swiss people in this video try to speak Hochdeutsch
2014-05-11 12:50:39	monsieurp	I've got to finish reading "Version Control With GIT" today
2014-05-11 12:50:44	colonolGron	and they still have accent like that
2014-05-11 12:50:51	colonolGron	but its not their natural way of speaking
2014-05-11 12:50:53	psytab	I couldn't understand this bald guy, though
2014-05-11 12:51:09	psytab	colonolGron, listen to the bald guy
2014-05-11 12:51:15	colonolGron	yes, he speaks standard swiss german
2014-05-11 12:51:39	tseno	is that what gave him baldness
2014-05-11 12:51:58	psytab	it sounds like something Scandinavian in some way
2014-05-11 12:52:01	colonolGron	but its still on the more easy ways of swiss german ;D there are dialects where you can understand nothing :D but at least you have to laugh
2014-05-11 12:52:05	colonolGron	probably tseno :P
2014-05-11 12:52:22	monsieurp	colonolGron: do you understand Swiss German effortlessly?
2014-05-11 12:52:33	colonolGron	the one in this video, yes
2014-05-11 12:52:57	colonolGron	i think most people who speak Badisch, have no problem with swiss german
2014-05-11 12:53:02	monsieurp	generell
2014-05-11 12:53:13	psytab	and nighmi once gave me a link to some video and at first I was wondering if it was some kind of dialect of Dutch that I didn't understand :P
2014-05-11 12:53:48	colonolGron	its such a small country, and has so many dialects
2014-05-11 12:54:04	monsieurp	psytab: how's the Java certification revision coming along?
2014-05-11 12:54:07	Leopejo	it's called mountains :D
2014-05-11 12:54:42	colonolGron	i thought so too Leopejo :P but even the difference between Basel and here is so great, and i am not sure if there are so many mountains between. and both is so close to germany
2014-05-11 12:54:52	colonolGron	its 2 hours to the west though

2014-05-11 14:36:12	Leopejo	you cannot command the heart, but it is nicer when heart brain eye and stomach agree.

2014-05-11 14:37:19	Lumilintu	well, I don't like Eeva too much
2014-05-11 14:37:29	Lumilintu	I'm more into the really Finnic names :P

2014-05-11 14:37:50	Leopejo	from the height point of view, Lumilintu , as much as you would be disappointed in me.
2014-05-11 14:37:55	laikas	oh i like some really finnic names too, but most slavs cant say them
2014-05-11 14:38:03	laikas	because they have vowels that slavs dont have

2014-05-11 14:39:14	Leopejo	though it doesn't sound like that at all
2014-05-11 14:39:26	laikas	also, there is a difference i  finnish between ront diphthong ai, and neutral diphthong ei
2014-05-11 14:39:33	laikas	slavs can say ei
2014-05-11 14:39:35	laikas	ей
2014-05-11 14:39:44	laikas	but not ai (with dots)
2014-05-11 14:40:31	laikas	ai exists in australian english, but not ei
2014-05-11 14:40:51	laikas	so words like train and fete, etc are all /ai/ words

2014-05-11 18:09:56	laikas	japanese is also one of those languages that has a relatively large number of speakers, but theyre all in a tiny dot on the surface of the globe
2014-05-11 18:10:40	laikas	so that if you never go to that dot, youll neer run into them... despite the fact that wuite a few of them exist
2014-05-11 18:11:03	Karavinka	and laikas, i didn't say that specifically to you though
2014-05-11 18:11:11	Karavinka	i never complain when you speak croatian :p
2014-05-11 18:11:17	laikas	i know :)
2014-05-11 18:11:19	laikas	heh
2014-05-11 18:11:33	laikas	actually we have a dair few japanese speakers here
2014-05-11 18:11:40	laikas	over 30,000
2014-05-11 18:11:55	laikas	but we have slightly more korean soeakers than japanese speakers
2014-05-11 18:12:40	laikas	the  again as of the last census we now have half a million mandarin speakers

2014-05-11 18:13:58	laikas	its unfortunate that there are so many more mandarin speakers than japanese speakers here
2014-05-11 18:14:11	laikas	maybe we should invent our own one child policy
2014-05-11 18:14:11	Leopejo	pero' stranamente non hanno soltanto calcolo delle reazioni dei vincoli
2014-05-11 18:14:12	Karavinka	i wouldn't be surprised if it either already is or soon will be the second place in australia
2014-05-11 18:14:21	laikas	but only for soeakers of yucky languages
2014-05-11 18:14:29	Karavinka	laikas: like croatian?
2014-05-11 18:14:32	Leopejo	ma anche calcolo delle forze interne delle travi (N, taglio, momento flettente)

2014-05-11 18:18:38	laikas	spanish is much sexy!
2014-05-11 18:19:04	laikas	all languages should take a page out of spanishs book, and try to sound more sexy
2014-05-11 18:19:18	laikas	i guess the sexiest asian language is probably japanese
2014-05-11 18:19:30	laikas	south east asian, i mean
2014-05-11 18:19:43	laikas	or east asia , in the case of japanese
2014-05-11 18:20:09	laikas	tagalog is the nicest sounding, but its not even remotely sexy
2014-05-11 18:20:11	Soassae	Leopejo: per chi hai votato?
2014-05-11 18:20:26	Leopejo	io sono gia' complottista e sono convinto che i voti di San Marino all'Azerbaidjan invece che all'Italia siano frutto di corruzione :D

2014-05-11 18:20:40	laikas	indo/malay arent bad
2014-05-11 18:20:53	laikas	thai is the nicest tonal language by far
2014-05-11 18:20:56	Leopejo	so your anti-Frenchness didn't get to nighmi's levels ;)
2014-05-11 18:21:05	laikas	are you still learning thai, karavinka?
2014-05-11 18:21:26	Leopejo	e poi lo sai Soassae che sono piu' genovese di te.
2014-05-11 18:21:36	Karavinka	not since the school started
2014-05-11 18:21:56	laikas	how far did you get? basic concersation at least?
2014-05-11 18:22:09	laikas	you seem to do wuite well at anything you put hour mind to

2014-05-11 18:22:52	Karavinka	(unless i'm going to use it immediately, of course)
2014-05-11 18:23:08	Karavinka	but just enough that i can read and decipher some thai lyrics
2014-05-11 18:23:14	Karavinka	with a lot of dictionary legworks
2014-05-11 18:23:24	laikas	heh
2014-05-11 18:23:35	laikas	if i were you, id focus on convo big time
2014-05-11 18:23:52	Karavinka	i still read extremely slow, so i'll need to put more efforts in that direction
2014-05-11 18:24:04	botanista	Hey Soassae!
2014-05-11 18:24:05	Karavinka	AND then i'll make use of manga translated to thai
2014-05-11 18:24:06	laikas	the thing is... if you get your language skills to a great level, as you did with japanese, you can pass for a native

2014-05-11 18:31:24	Soassae	why and where should one assume you speak French because you are white?? :O

2014-05-11 18:32:36	Soassae	in fact, at least here, chances are that a coloured person speaks French, rather than a white one
2014-05-11 18:33:01	Karavinka	and what's the problem with that?
2014-05-11 18:33:10	Soassae	glavkos: no no, i am italian. i have never traveled to Russia
2014-05-11 18:33:13	Karavinka	i can't tell a chinese apart from a korean or a japanese
2014-05-11 18:33:22	Karavinka	(especially the northern chinese)
2014-05-11 18:33:35	glavkos	I think that if you travel alone in Russia
2014-05-11 18:33:37	laikas	but you could definitely pick a vietnamese out!
2014-05-11 18:33:42	glavkos	you should be quite careful
2014-05-11 18:33:43	Karavinka	if they make a wrong assumption then i correct them

2014-05-11 18:42:29	Karavinka	OF COURSE nothing is scary when you grow up with it
2014-05-11 18:42:29	laikas	vowelless*
2014-05-11 18:42:43	Karavinka	like ejectives, i had no idea what they were in georgian until i found out
2014-05-11 18:42:46	Karavinka	that korean had it
2014-05-11 18:42:48	Karavinka	lol
2014-05-11 18:42:56	laikas	most of them cant hear the difference between jubav and ljubav
2014-05-11 18:43:30	laikas	and when i make it -really- obvious, and then ask "could you hear it?" they usually say "only slightly"
2014-05-11 18:43:51	tseno	laikas: go to sleep
2014-05-11 18:44:06	laikas	if getting them to hear it wasnt hard enough, getting them to reproduce it is near impossible

2014-05-11 18:45:43	tseno	laikas: i got it
2014-05-11 18:45:45	Karavinka	i probably can't conjugate olen olet anymore
2014-05-11 18:45:56	Leopejo	nobody conjugates olen olet anyway in Finland
2014-05-11 18:46:03	Leopejo	it's oon oot there ;)
2014-05-11 18:46:11	laikas	olen, olet, on, olemme, olette, ovat
2014-05-11 18:46:16	Karavinka	minä sinä sehän and what were the rest?

2014-05-11 18:47:15	laikas	in the spoken language they usually conjugate olla differently
2014-05-11 18:47:25	Karavinka	i probably remember ~20 words max
2014-05-11 18:47:27	Karavinka	let me try
2014-05-11 18:47:45	laikas	ma oon, sa oot, se on, me ollaan, te ootte, ne on... imperarive form: oo
2014-05-11 18:48:10	Karavinka	iso "big" maa "land" suomi "finland" tervetuloa "welcome" kuninga "king" kuningatar "queen" yksilainen "alone" yksi kaksi kolma "one two three"
2014-05-11 18:48:24	Karavinka	i'm running out of vocabulary!
2014-05-11 18:48:25	laikas	kuningas
2014-05-11 18:48:31	Karavinka	ah kuningas
2014-05-11 18:48:43	Leopejo	yksin perhaps
2014-05-11 18:48:45	Leopejo	kolme
2014-05-11 18:48:47	Leopejo	but not bad
2014-05-11 18:48:54	laikas	and kolme
2014-05-11 18:48:55	Karavinka	is taksi a word? it should be
2014-05-11 18:48:56	Leopejo	especially the kuningas kuningatar, you won
2014-05-11 18:49:08	laikas	rhe rest was pretty food
2014-05-11 18:49:09	Leopejo	won't find then in the first chapters of a textbook
2014-05-11 18:49:12	Leopejo	taksi yes
2014-05-11 18:49:20	laikas	good*
2014-05-11 18:49:30	laikas	i dont know about yksilainen
2014-05-11 18:49:41	laikas	i think sometimes they use yhten for alone
2014-05-11 18:49:50	laikas	or yksin, sorry
2014-05-11 18:49:53	laikas	my bad
2014-05-11 18:50:22	Karavinka	hmm and ilmaa + partitive was probably "without ..."
2014-05-11 18:50:25	laikas	"yksin ja kahden " - "alone and in a couple"
2014-05-11 18:50:34	laikas	yes, one -a
2014-05-11 18:50:39	Karavinka	lol my memory is so random
2014-05-11 18:50:47	laikas	ilman i think
2014-05-11 18:50:55	Karavinka	ilman? perhaps
2014-05-11 18:51:11	laikas	its been a while since i looked at finnish
2014-05-11 18:51:38	laikas	ilman takes a partitive if used as a preposition, and the fenitive if used as a postposition, iirc
2014-05-11 18:52:30	Karavinka	well who knows, i may go back to finnish
2014-05-11 18:52:31	laikas	lol @ fenitive!!!
2014-05-11 18:52:32	Karavinka	once i'm retired
2014-05-11 18:52:38	Leopejo	ilman
2014-05-11 18:52:38	laikas	phone of doom!!!
2014-05-11 18:52:43	laikas	i meant genitive
2014-05-11 18:52:47	Leopejo	ilmaa is partitive of ilma, air
2014-05-11 18:52:58	laikas	anyway, phone thping hasdriven me insane :p
2014-05-11 18:53:12	laikas	which means, at 1am, ill try to get a little sleep before work
2014-05-11 18:53:18	laikas	gnight all:)
2014-05-11 18:53:20	Leopejo	in that case let me wish you retirement soon ;)
2014-05-11 18:53:30	laikas	ценко, добро спавай :)
2014-05-11 18:53:42	laikas	gone - hopefully sleeping

2014-05-11 18:55:21	Leopejo	in quel caso mi devo far pagare :D

2014-05-11 18:58:04	Timoteo	since I suspect that in a language channel there are certainly a lot of TeX/LaTeX users; here the TeX package you've been waiting for: http://hanno-rein.de/archives/349

2014-05-11 18:58:17	Timoteo	nugs, you old spoiler
2014-05-11 18:58:35	cJIaB	what is tex/latex?
2014-05-11 18:58:53	cJIaB	I've read those words in some forsaken websites
2014-05-11 18:59:05	Timoteo	the text processing system you use, when you need anything advanced
2014-05-11 18:59:32	Timoteo	really great with math formulars and foreign scripts/writingsystems
2014-05-11 18:59:42	Timoteo	renders the stuff beautifully
2014-05-11 18:59:44	cJIaB	r u sure even javascript hasn't surpass that?
2014-05-11 18:59:47	Timoteo	yes

2014-05-11 18:59:59	Timoteo	though there have been javascript implementations of TeX
2014-05-11 19:00:07	Timoteo	partly and I think even one full one
2014-05-11 19:00:13	tseno	javascript is a fascinating language
2014-05-11 19:01:08	Timoteo	in fact, its quite commonly used by book publishers.. authors might still hand in their stuff in word or so, but it then gets transformed into a tex document.. at least with the better publishers
2014-05-11 19:01:21	cJIaB	rendering? so it is maybe like a printing preparation
2014-05-11 19:01:56	Karavinka	tseno: do you speak javascript?
2014-05-11 19:02:04	Timoteo	its text processing.. you can write your book, thesis, promotion or anything really in there.. but it can directly be rendered into print-ready formats from there, and as such its used all through the process of a book publishing
2014-05-11 19:02:08	Karavinka	oops, it's not something you speak
2014-05-11 19:02:09	tseno	rendering is the proces of transforming the page description ot a physical representation of the document
2014-05-11 19:02:41	Soassae	Leopejo: dai, che cosa mi insegni? conosco qualche saluto, i numeri, qualche verbo e la declinazione di talo :P
2014-05-11 19:02:53	Timoteo	well.. can be used in all processes.. the reality is, that most authors don't bother with it, and so usually it starts to be used after the work was handed in
2014-05-11 19:02:58	Leopejo	oh quest'ultima mi sorprende.
2014-05-11 19:03:00	Leopejo	Sentiamo.
2014-05-11 19:03:20	Timoteo	the more scientific authros however have hardly any other choice but to use it
2014-05-11 19:03:25	Timoteo	often that is
2014-05-11 19:03:34	 *	Leopejo stays away from science then
2014-05-11 19:04:01	Timoteo	I wholeheartedly can recommend you to learn it, if you ever want to write something larger or more complicated
2014-05-11 19:04:09	cJIaB	can't they just use microsoft word or open office
2014-05-11 19:04:25	Timoteo	too complicated to do the same things in there
2014-05-11 19:04:30	Timoteo	and often with bad results.. if any
2014-05-11 19:04:45	Soassae	talo / talon/ talo / taloa/ talona / taloksi / talossa / talosta / taloon / talolla / talolta / talolle / talotta / taloineen
2014-05-11 19:04:46	Leopejo	but scientific text usually is just plain text with a couple of figures
2014-05-11 19:04:52	Soassae	Leopejo: giusto?
2014-05-11 19:04:54	tseno	and there are ideological arguments against it too :)
2014-05-11 19:04:59	Leopejo	Soassae, da dove l'hai copiato?
2014-05-11 19:05:05	Soassae	me lo ricordo !
2014-05-11 19:05:16	Leopejo	interessante l'ordine
2014-05-11 19:05:20	Soassae	mmhh
2014-05-11 19:05:24	Soassae	come lo recitate voi?
2014-05-11 19:05:31	Leopejo	mai recitato
2014-05-11 19:05:34	Soassae	ah
2014-05-11 19:05:38	Leopejo	comunque io li gruppo cosi':
2014-05-11 19:05:42	Leopejo	i casi fondamentali:
2014-05-11 19:05:57	Leopejo	talo, talon, taloa
2014-05-11 19:06:06	Leopejo	i casi locativi:
2014-05-11 19:06:14	Timoteo	well Leopejo, I've worked with large documents in word and openoffice before.. it's a nightmare.. not just does it get slowly with large content, its really easy to destroy the whole document.. you end up using most time making backups/versioning and trying to push stuff around.. I claim infeasability of layouting in word/openoffice
2014-05-11 19:06:22	Leopejo	talossa, taloon, talosta; talolla, talolle, talolta
2014-05-11 19:06:27	Leopejo	e il resto.
2014-05-11 19:06:45	Soassae	Leopejo: si, in effetti e piu pratico :)
2014-05-11 19:06:46	Leopejo	poi hmm quale sarebbe il terzo caso della tua lista, Soassae ?
2014-05-11 19:06:51	Soassae	acc
2014-05-11 19:06:57	Soassae	no?
2014-05-11 19:07:17	Leopejo	Timoteo, I only worked in Word
2014-05-11 19:07:25	Leopejo	passo di la'
2014-05-11 19:07:29	Soassae	vabbe, che poi sarebbe il nom o il part a seconda della situazione, ne'?
2014-05-11 19:08:03	Soassae	Timoteo: i only write texts with Latex
2014-05-11 19:08:37	Soassae	with Word, i can basically do nothing....
2014-05-11 19:08:44	cJIaB	and why don't u write in eps?
2014-05-11 19:08:51	Timoteo	yea.. there are also linguistic packages btw, Leopejo
2014-05-11 19:09:24	Timoteo	for example qtree: \Tree [.S [.NP LaTeX ] [.VP [.V is ] [.NP fun ] ] ] is automaticly rendered to the syntaxtree https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Latex_qtree_simple_tree.png/220px-Latex_qtree_simple_tree.png
2014-05-11 19:09:24	Leopejo	I let my bosses dictate what they want :D
2014-05-11 19:09:29	Leopejo	not that I have any boss anymore.

2014-05-11 19:09:56	cJIaB	is it something like eps Timoteo?
2014-05-11 19:10:08	Timoteo	eps is a tex-close format
2014-05-11 19:10:26	Timoteo	you can use it as image within a tex file
2014-05-11 19:10:35	Timoteo	(embedded postscript if im not mistaken)
2014-05-11 19:10:36	tseno	microsoft's office is like .. wysiwyg... and with wysiwyg it's natural that editing gets heavier as the document grows
2014-05-11 19:10:51	tseno	and you obviously have less control over the rendering process
2014-05-11 19:11:25	Timoteo	yea.. the learningcurve is ofcourse higher with tex compared to wysiwyg, but you end up having a lot more control over everything

2014-05-11 19:13:26	Timoteo	its quite easy using IPA in your documents if you just can use a predefined "code" for it in your text...
2014-05-11 19:13:39	Timoteo	instead of having to use some formular editor and search every single character
2014-05-11 19:13:56	Timoteo	ofc you have to learn that code, but you end up being faster in the long run

2014-05-11 19:21:06	tseno	3d printing is still too expensive as opposed to all other technologies which we have nowadays and which are more accessible ... and acheive the same result ... 3d printing is still a curiosity
2014-05-11 19:21:44	Timoteo	I think the society is still experimenting what it can do with it.. but we'll probably see some good usage eventually
2014-05-11 19:23:02	tseno	i'm sure of that too... it's an abstract concept which can apply to building houses as well as to building home appliences .. it has great potencial
2014-05-11 19:23:18	Leopejo	I remember studying 3d printing in the nineties
2014-05-11 19:23:46	tseno	Leopejo: tell us more
2014-05-11 19:23:49	Leopejo	some of the file formats used in 3d solid modeling were created for 3d printing
2014-05-11 19:24:33	Leopejo	back then it was the big car makers who used solid modeling for rapid prototyping
2014-05-11 19:24:46	tseno	in 3d printing your ink can be bricks just aswell as metal or even glass .. how nice is that :)

2014-05-11 20:12:46	Leopejo	1) I prefer some other similar things, 2) I prefer to use them only when I need, 3) I prefer to keep my blood fluid with wine ;)

2014-05-11 20:16:08	jubo2	tseno: BCAA are the only 3 aminoacids that cannot be manufactured from other aminoacids by the body
2014-05-11 20:16:22	tseno	i see... i didn't know that
2014-05-11 20:16:35	Leopejo	that's my only concession to "drugs"
2014-05-11 20:16:51	jubo2	so for optimal anabolic and minimal catabolic you need to make sure you are getting enough BCAA from a supplement or diet
2014-05-11 20:17:41	tseno	but Leopejo doesn't need minimal catabolic ... he's "fat"
2014-05-11 20:18:12	jubo2	you need minimal catabolic to maintain and build muscle tissue
2014-05-11 20:18:15	Leopejo	I also don't need anabolic, on the contrary
2014-05-11 20:18:29	tseno	woops :)
2014-05-11 20:18:36	jubo2	you do realize that muscle tissue consumes energy even when sleeping

2014-05-11 20:19:37	jubo2	What's wrong with polska food ?
2014-05-11 20:20:21	Leopejo	too fat, too energy intensive, too little vegetables and fruit

2014-05-11 21:04:21	loulan	it's pretty nice

2014-05-11 21:04:50	loulan	ah yeah
2014-05-11 21:04:54	monsieurp	so do plenty of major capitals
2014-05-11 21:04:57	loulan	also, no sea or mountains
2014-05-11 21:04:59	loulan	no nature

2014-05-11 21:08:26	Leopejo	London or Paris? Paris for me
2014-05-11 21:08:27	monsieurp	have you ever strolled in a city and run into MOUNTAINS of litters in literally every corner of the city you were wandering to?

2014-05-11 21:10:27	monsieurp	London is a great place. My biggest pet peeve with it is the transportation system aka the Tube. One of the most rubbish of western civilizations and also one of the most expensive.
2014-05-11 21:10:40	loulan	I hate how american cities
2014-05-11 21:10:44	loulan	are made for cars
2014-05-11 21:10:47	Soassae	Montreal is great in June and July but then... there are the other 10 months.....
2014-05-11 21:10:56	loulan	they don't have a lot of small pedestrian areas with bars and stuff
2014-05-11 21:11:00	monsieurp	When I was there 3 years ago, it was bloody pricey. I reckon with the Olympics have gone through the roof since.
2014-05-11 21:11:02	loulan	montreal can get insanely hot in the summer
2014-05-11 21:11:18	loulan	last time I was there it was 36°C and so HUMID

2014-05-11 22:56:55	Leopejo	about an Estonian girl who studied in Tartu.
2014-05-11 22:57:02	psytab	and my Estonian and Norwegian (reading) books are featuring prominently at the front of the upper shelf of my bookcase
2014-05-11 22:57:14	Leopejo	what about your Finnish textbooks, psytab ?

2014-05-12 21:40:05	hollyblue	Leopejo: ja się trochę wstydzę tych Słowianek, bo wszyscy teraz będą myśleli, że Polki w Polsce jedyne co robią to masło i pranie nosząc ubrania z głębokimi dekoltami
2014-05-12 21:40:11	laikas	im guessing there are 300,000 amish worldwide clint

2014-05-12 21:40:19	Leopejo	hollyblue, szkoda że nie byłaś tutaj w sobotę wieczorem, mieliśmy fajny wieczorek oglądajać Eurowizję
2014-05-12 21:40:26	Clinteger	and the reality is that very many families are successful when /both the mother and father, or mother and mother, or father and father/ hold full time jobs
2014-05-12 21:40:26	yosko	image d'une société en perte de repères, etf

2014-05-12 21:41:24	Clinteger	parmi les polonais :-) et le "soviétique"
2014-05-12 21:41:31	noonday	but then there is also the idea... that a man can´t do the shopping, cooking, or cleaning... because it robs him of his masculinity
2014-05-12 21:41:32	Covered	hollyblue: :D

2014-05-12 21:41:48	Clinteger	in my house my dad always did the shopping and cooking
2014-05-12 21:41:49	Leopejo	no to prawda hollyblue

2014-05-12 21:42:37	noonday	Clinteger, the Russians would say to your dad... are you a real man... why is the wife not doing her job of managing the household? what´s wrong with her?

2014-05-12 21:44:31	Clinteger	i don't think the amish are ridiculous
2014-05-12 21:44:35	Clinteger	they have their reasons, which i respect enough

2014-05-12 21:44:46	laikas	i think youre a lovely young man, but i definitely think some of your iews are ridiculous :p
2014-05-12 21:44:49	huf	depends on what facet of amishness we're talking about
2014-05-12 21:44:55	Leopejo	a jak Pani matura?
2014-05-12 21:44:55	huf	i think they're big on rigid binary gender roles too
2014-05-12 21:44:59	huf	which is ridiculous
2014-05-12 21:45:00	noonday	Well, I would never think that people who think differently are ridiculous
2014-05-12 21:45:05	Clinteger	DissidentRage well I haven't seen it here, I don't know much Italian cheese that makes its way to my little corner of france

2014-05-12 21:45:16	laikas	hear hear noonday
2014-05-12 21:45:25	noonday	I think... the tendency to want to enforce binary gender roles is about the fear of not having a stable society

2014-05-12 21:45:46	laikas	noonday, i dont want to enforce them
2014-05-12 21:45:48	noonday	like... people who are very traditional fear that if you give people more freedom... it means that anarchy will flourish
2014-05-12 21:45:49	Clinteger	noonday but in reality i think society will stay stable regardless
2014-05-12 21:45:56	noonday	Clinteger, in general yes
2014-05-12 21:46:00	laikas	butthose gender roles -do- work for most people on our planet
2014-05-12 21:46:03	DissidentRage	noonday: bring on the anarchy
2014-05-12 21:46:06	noonday	unless some disturbing trend comes along
2014-05-12 21:46:07	laikas	and they work for a reason
2014-05-12 21:46:09	DissidentRage	somewhat
2014-05-12 21:46:10	DissidentRage	anyway
2014-05-12 21:46:11	Clinteger	that's the reason though we have religious folks in the US who say that homosexuality is a disease that will drive our "oh so perfect" nation to ruin
2014-05-12 21:46:20	laikas	so im against labeling them as weong
2014-05-12 21:46:26	Leopejo	I myself have perhaps never had provolone
2014-05-12 21:46:32	laikas	if it aint broke, dont fix it
2014-05-12 21:46:36	noonday	Clinteger: homosexuality is limited to a certain percent of the population.... it doesn´t threaten heterosexuality
2014-05-12 21:46:38	noonday	that´s my view
2014-05-12 21:46:39	DissidentRage	Clinteger: funny that the people who are so anti-gay end up being caught snorting blow off a make hooker's dong

2014-05-12 21:47:39	noonday	Clinteger: I think it´s natural for people to see a sexuality that is not their own as gross
2014-05-12 21:47:45	Clinteger	yes indeed
2014-05-12 21:47:49	laikas	well everything is limited to a certain percentage of rhe population noondsy
2014-05-12 21:47:49	DissidentRage	well it grosses me out but that's because I'm not attracted to dudes, not because I have some kind of agenda
2014-05-12 21:47:52	Clinteger	i don't particularly like watching men and women kiss :p
2014-05-12 21:48:01	DissidentRage	yeah
2014-05-12 21:48:05	Clinteger	but i've seen it so much always in my life that it's kind of…"normal"?
2014-05-12 21:48:06	tseno	Clinteger: really ?
2014-05-12 21:48:09	laikas	obesity, red hair, speaking vietnamese natively

2014-05-12 21:48:45	noonday	I honestly feel uncomfortable with women who dress provocatively
2014-05-12 21:48:55	Clinteger	but when it … lasts a long time i think they should probably not be in public
2014-05-12 21:48:56	noonday	It´s not like I think they have no right to... they absolutely have the right to
2014-05-12 21:48:57	hollyblue	Leopejo: studentka siedziała w komisjach maturalnych?
2014-05-12 21:49:02	laikas	i also value modest dress
2014-05-12 21:49:08	DissidentRage	noonday: I feel uncomfortable too but I suspect for a different reason
2014-05-12 21:49:11	noonday	But it places me in a difficult situation.. if she dresses provocatively, how am I supposed to look at her?
2014-05-12 21:49:20	Clinteger	well
2014-05-12 21:49:23	Leopejo	ani w nich ani w komisjach wyborczych
2014-05-12 21:49:24	DissidentRage	ah
2014-05-12 21:49:27	Clinteger	i have no problem with women dressing provocatively lol
2014-05-12 21:49:30	DissidentRage	yeah I just think "ok, don't look, don't look... please don't get slapped"
2014-05-12 21:49:34	Clinteger	its kind of common in my generation
2014-05-12 21:49:44	noonday	no.... neither do I, but I am not used to it enough that I can look at it calmly

2014-05-12 21:50:38	laikas	that is so stereotypically gay
2014-05-12 21:50:39	noonday	it´s a paradox... when women dress provocatively, men still aren´t allowed to gawk at them
2014-05-12 21:50:40	Clinteger	think of all the animals who died for your pants
2014-05-12 21:50:43	DissidentRage	lol laikas
2014-05-12 21:50:56	DissidentRage	Clinteger: yeah, they're now delicious burgers
2014-05-12 21:50:59	yosko	sometimes the nakedness or the provocative outfits are out of place out of context so we fight with what we should feel and with what we really feel and that's awkward :)

2014-05-12 23:21:14	yosko	yeah, well, among Soassae's skills the one I prefer is his uncanny ability of creating black holes, they're so practical.... you know, for putting the garbage inside ;)
2014-05-12 23:21:23	Clinteger	tseno because the situations are kinda rare
2014-05-12 23:21:29	tseno	ok

2014-05-12 23:24:17	Soassae	yosko: haha noooooo you should not teach that :P bad uncle :P
2014-05-12 23:24:22	yosko	Clinteger: your native language is English if my memory doesn't fail me :P
2014-05-12 23:24:47	Leopejo	well
2014-05-12 23:24:52	Clinteger	i always thought usually people do one language one parent, and then another third language maybe the one spoken in the region they live
2014-05-12 23:25:03	Leopejo	people say Clinteger 's English is not native
2014-05-12 23:25:06	Clinteger	yosko your memory doesn't, but i'd forgive you because my english is strange :p
2014-05-12 23:25:13	yosko	Soassae: yeah, well, she gotta learn the important things first, I like that line e non mi credere irragiungibile, caue ther guy actually thinks she is ;)

2014-05-12 23:25:43	Leopejo	:D
2014-05-12 23:25:51	yosko	Clinteger: it can't be, you're a native speaker and even if it is, it's strange in a native way :P
2014-05-12 23:25:52	 *	tseno laughs
2014-05-12 23:26:03	Leopejo	no, it is strange in a Clinteger way

2014-05-12 23:26:25	tseno	Leopejo: he's from a village
2014-05-12 23:26:25	DissidentRage	Clinteger: soz man :P
2014-05-12 23:26:29	yosko	I'm of the opinion that native speakers are ALWAYS right
2014-05-12 23:26:33	Clinteger	so we go around saying "oh i have to broom the kitchen"
2014-05-12 23:26:44	Leopejo	I'm of the opinion that native speakers are always wrong.
2014-05-12 23:26:46	Clinteger	or we had inscription for classes
2014-05-12 23:26:50	yosko	broom the kitchen=cool

2014-05-13 18:48:11	olti	assimil the method..
2014-05-13 18:48:25	Expug	i'm not always sure what is A2 and what is B1, sometimes I think I'm A2 and am B1, sometimes it's the other way round
2014-05-13 18:48:46	Karavinka	and as for assimil, i used to shuffle it and shadow it real-time (simultaneously) while i'm commuting
2014-05-13 18:49:14	Karavinka	back then i probably memorized at least half of the contents
2014-05-13 18:51:28	Karavinka	i mean, i can't possibly do an assimil in an arguelles-esque way

2014-05-13 19:27:31	Karavinka	like AINU

2014-05-13 19:29:15	Karavinka	oh i want to learn endangered languages to help them revive their heritage blah blah blah but there's no resource for them
2014-05-13 19:29:18	DissidentRage	pretty sure that's not a standard thing
2014-05-13 19:29:30	Karavinka	so i created one. i made a 52 lesson-long ainu course freely available on unilang
2014-05-13 19:29:34	Karavinka	and nobody cared!
2014-05-13 19:29:36	DissidentRage	@op, %halfop, +voice
2014-05-13 19:29:38	yosko	the people I hated the most were those who conversed fluently in esperanto

2014-05-13 19:29:41	Karavinka	:p
2014-05-13 19:30:18	Karavinka	since then i'm skeptical to anyone online who pretends to take interest in weird obscure languages "to help revive the languages"
2014-05-13 19:30:24	Karavinka	unless they can really prove it
2014-05-13 19:30:26	yosko	yeah, well, a lot of weird things happened back then.... but they're buried in the past now, we shouldn't revive them shhhhhh
2014-05-13 19:30:53	yosko	yeah, well, I'm israeli, I've already revived my own language, I don't care for the rest :P
2014-05-13 19:31:22	Karavinka	cool attitude
2014-05-13 19:31:30	yosko	but there were cool people there, I'm glad they're here now ;)
2014-05-13 19:32:02	yosko	like, I could've revived dalmatian!!!! but the last speaker died a few years ago so what am I supposed to do? Move to Pula and talk to the bushes there?
2014-05-13 19:32:45	yosko	I miss Johan....
2014-05-13 19:32:46	Karavinka	don't worry dalmatian lives on... as a name of a dog breed

2014-05-13 19:45:21	DissidentRage	but I've looked at it less since I've gotten a job again
2014-05-13 19:45:22	Karavinka	yosko: it's like the garbage can of the internet
2014-05-13 19:45:34	yosko	yeha, I checked it out
2014-05-13 19:45:50	DissidentRage	it is both the source of pretty much all hilarity as well as degeneracy of the internet
2014-05-13 19:46:06	yosko	I see
2014-05-13 19:46:25	Karavinka	yeah, 4chan makes a lot of internet memes (at least in english language parts of the internet)
2014-05-13 19:46:36	yosko	so let's have a classic conversation, where are you from and what languages are you interested in? :P
2014-05-13 19:46:57	DissidentRage	Virginia, US learning Norwegian as I plan to move to Norway
2014-05-13 19:47:04	yosko	oh, nice :)
2014-05-13 19:47:11	Karavinka	but still, 4chan is still a copy of the glorious futaba channel
2014-05-13 19:47:20	 *	Karavinka weaboos it out
2014-05-13 19:47:20	yosko	futaba....
2014-05-13 19:47:23	DissidentRage	pft
2014-05-13 19:48:09	yosko	well, you know that being amrican you don't really need to learn norwegian to move to Norway right? :P
2014-05-13 19:48:12	Karavinka	and hi yosko, I'm from Vienna, Austria and I'm learning English nice to meet you
2014-05-13 19:48:17	tseno	yosko: \o/
2014-05-13 19:48:40	DissidentRage	yosko: except for the part where I need to find work
2014-05-13 19:48:59	DissidentRage	yeah IT in particular is mostly dominated by English speakers but
2014-05-13 19:49:15	DissidentRage	I feel like not having Norwegian down puts me at a significant disadvantage in terms of hiring
2014-05-13 19:49:29	yosko	Karavinka: you're not from Vienna, you were born in Korea, raised in Canada and you eat suids out of a can....
2014-05-13 19:49:34	yosko	squids
2014-05-13 19:49:41	soldeace	besides, Norwegian seems pretty easy to learn
2014-05-13 19:50:00	DissidentRage	soldeace: yeah it is, which is great for a non-language-learner like myself
2014-05-13 19:50:10	yosko	maybe but everybody there speaks english, I mean, not as well as in Sweden but you'll get by in English
2014-05-13 19:50:12	DissidentRage	I can pick up programming languages well enough
2014-05-13 19:50:28	DissidentRage	spoken languages not so much
2014-05-13 19:50:46	yosko	but Norwegian shouldn't be that hard to learn, at least not the grammar, the pronunciation is... well :|
2014-05-13 19:51:08	Karavinka	well that's all true
2014-05-13 19:51:10	yosko	probably cause you haven't tried until now? :P
2014-05-13 19:51:11	DissidentRage	yeah I don't really have someone I can practice pronunciation with on a regular basis
2014-05-13 19:51:18	Karavinka	though squids don't really come in cans
2014-05-13 19:51:21	Karavinka	octopuses
2014-05-13 19:51:30	DissidentRage	I took Spanish and German in high school :P
2014-05-13 19:51:33	DissidentRage	didn't do that well
2014-05-13 19:51:34	yosko	yeah, well, octopuses, it's all so unkosher....
2014-05-13 19:51:43	Karavinka	ouch
2014-05-13 19:51:47	 *	Karavinka can't be a jew
2014-05-13 19:52:09	yosko	yeah, but who learns languages in school? nobody does, language teaching in schools is always awful
2014-05-13 19:52:32	DissidentRage	it may have also been that I didn't feel an actual need for it which didn't motivate me enough
2014-05-13 19:52:48	DissidentRage	I feel like Norwegian in an academic setting would be beneficial for me
2014-05-13 19:52:55	yosko	Karavinka: and I just remember you can't drink milk, which is pretty normal, you're asian but I remember we talked about that :P
2014-05-13 19:53:11	Karavinka	DissidentRage: that's usually the biggest downer with school learning
2014-05-13 19:53:14	Karavinka	the motivation thing
2014-05-13 19:53:35	yosko	DissidentRage: it's all a matter of motivation, most people in school care as much for languafes as they care for math :P
2014-05-13 19:53:44	Karavinka	yosko: yeap i'm quite intolerant
2014-05-13 19:53:44	Karavinka	regarding lactose i mean
2014-05-13 19:53:50	DissidentRage	cared more for math :P
2014-05-13 19:53:56	yosko	some just like them and learn them
2014-05-13 19:54:06	yosko	well, I cared for math but I was really bad at it
2014-05-13 19:54:07	soldeace	Karavinka, I'm intolerant either
2014-05-13 19:54:15	soldeace	I can't tolerate a glass full of milk, I must empty it
2014-05-13 19:54:34	DissidentRage	I did fairly well at geometry and trigonometry, not so much algebra
2014-05-13 19:54:41	yosko	wow
2014-05-13 19:55:02	DissidentRage	if I can see visualize how something is used I do better
2014-05-13 19:55:04	Karavinka	i should drag yosko around seoul and feed him insects, invertebrates and boiled pig heads
2014-05-13 19:55:15	yosko	algebra was easier for me, geometry and trigonometry were my worst nightmares :|
2014-05-13 19:55:17	DissidentRage	algebra seems kind of subjective
2014-05-13 19:55:29	yosko	Karavinka: I can't eat that :P
2014-05-13 19:55:54	yosko	I mean, I'm ot observant, it's just that I wouldn't be able to :P
2014-05-13 19:56:11	yosko	It grosses me out lol, like people eating grasshoppers
2014-05-13 19:56:16	yosko	people here eat small snails :|
2014-05-13 19:56:27	yosko	in tomato sauce :|
2014-05-13 19:56:41	DissidentRage	I'll stick with steak and chicken breasts
2014-05-13 19:56:53	yosko	yeah, well, I'm better at subjective stuff, I was good at literature and writing and all that
2014-05-13 19:57:22	DissidentRage	yosko: I just have trouble with things that aren't.. empirical I guess... for instance
2014-05-13 19:57:32	DissidentRage	if you're wrong at geometry/trig, your stuff visibly breaks
2014-05-13 19:57:49	DissidentRage	"nope, gotta try again, obviously missed something"
2014-05-13 19:57:57	DissidentRage	algebra: you're right or wrong because it says so
2014-05-13 19:58:00	yosko	but it's very interesting what you're telling me here.... you should've met ale78, a guy from Russia who's now a math professor in New Jersey :)

2014-05-13 19:59:15	yosko	yeah, but algebra is more like a procedure you ought to follow in order to get a result, it's something you build little by little up to the end, trigonometry and notably geometry are like... more visual, I lack the skills to see it

2014-05-13 20:00:28	DissidentRage	yeah, I know logically it's like that, but the problem-solving part of my brain sees the way professors come up with ways of transforming equations and formulas
2014-05-13 20:00:41	DissidentRage	and sometimes goes "wait, how does this make sense? how am I supposed to know to do this?"

2014-05-13 21:03:36	Leopejo	I think 67 kg is the nearer
2014-05-13 21:03:47	Leopejo	though more of a goal than an actual weight :P

2014-05-13 21:08:06	Lumilintu	yosko: where I come from an average man would at least be 1,80 and an average woman around 1,70 :P

2014-05-13 22:33:50	thomashc	Java is actually very fast
2014-05-13 22:34:01	thomashc	the problem is that good java requires a good programer
2014-05-13 22:34:17	thomashc	If you're teaching it in every "intro to programming" class you're going to end up with lots of shitty java code
2014-05-13 22:34:38	DissidentRage	I guess the bulk fall into that category
2014-05-13 22:34:52	thomashc	they do
2014-05-13 22:34:54	DissidentRage	seems like a lot of Java applications will gladly use up nearly 1GB of RAM
2014-05-13 22:35:10	thomashc	the JVM does some executions as fast or *faster* than native code.
2014-05-13 22:35:14	DissidentRage	and you so much as step away for a few minutes they become unstable
2014-05-13 22:35:24	thomashc	DissidentRage: to be fair, RAM is cheap and plentiful.
2014-05-13 22:35:37	thomashc	but yeah, most of that is due to shitty programmers
2014-05-13 22:38:21	DissidentRage	I need to do more hardcore coding shit
2014-05-13 22:38:28	DissidentRage	instead of just processing fuckin web forms
2014-05-13 22:38:59	thomashc	fuck web development
2014-05-13 22:39:03	DissidentRage	yes
2014-05-13 22:39:35	DissidentRage	really when you've processed one form you've done them all
2014-05-13 22:39:35	thomashc	also fuck javascript and especially nodejs
2014-05-13 22:39:46	DissidentRage	and jQuery in particular
2014-05-13 22:39:53	thomashc	jQuery is fine, the problem is JS
2014-05-13 22:40:04	thomashc	and anything asynchronous
2014-05-13 22:40:08	thomashc	fuck callbacks
2014-05-13 22:40:13	DissidentRage	jQuery is cumbersome and completely fucks OOP even more
2014-05-13 22:41:41	DissidentRage	I honestly have a pretty firm grasp on the asynchronous part... used to cause me some grief when I first got it

2014-05-13 22:46:05	thomashc	we have coffeescript

2014-05-13 22:46:48	DissidentRage	isn't that a JS-like language with the fail and AIDS of Ruby?

2014-05-13 22:47:18	thomashc	fail and AIDS? Ruby has neither of those

2014-05-13 23:34:46	yosko	YEAH :)
2014-05-13 23:35:00	yosko	though I think most people change it to a vowel

2014-05-13 23:35:13	cntrational	no, not most
2014-05-13 23:35:13	Clinteger	cntrational i will say that my fuck and phoque could be very similar
2014-05-13 23:35:20	Clinteger	but in english vowels are less pure
2014-05-13 23:35:45	cntrational	yes

2014-05-13 23:36:44	DissidentRage	lol
2014-05-13 23:36:53	cntrational	yosko: that's not a soundchange, but a dialectal variation
2014-05-13 23:37:10	cntrational	Old Norse used "melk" and that was borrowed into some dialects of English
2014-05-13 23:37:43	yosko	I can see how phoque and fuck can sound alike

2014-05-13 23:37:45	Clinteger	where i grew up
2014-05-13 23:37:49	cntrational	(and Scandinavian languages still use some variation on "melk")
2014-05-13 23:38:00	yosko	cntrational: would you say it's dialectal? O.o
2014-05-13 23:38:02	Clinteger	some people said milk and some said melk
2014-05-13 23:38:08	Clinteger	and some people say pillow and some people say pellow
2014-05-13 23:38:08	cntrational	yosko: yes
2014-05-13 23:38:09	yosko	yeah
2014-05-13 23:38:13	cntrational	idiolectal, maybe
2014-05-13 23:38:23	Clinteger	sometimes you'll find one person who says melk and pillow :p
2014-05-13 23:38:28	yosko	yeah, sorry, I was thinking about the l pronounced as a vowel, not about the milk melk thing
2014-05-13 23:38:49	cntrational	yosko: l pronounced as a vowel is also dialectal

2014-05-14 19:07:37	yosko	I'm an atheist :P
2014-05-14 19:07:41	Catharina	nice
2014-05-14 19:08:01	yosko	yeah :) I never believed in God, I was born into judaism so that's it
2014-05-14 19:08:38	Catharina	same here. i'm reading Richard Dawkins' The God Delusion right now, and it's talking about how you don't have to stick with your parents' religion
2014-05-14 19:08:38	yosko	I like unitarian universalism or the idea I have about it, sounds a lot like Spinoza :)
2014-05-14 19:08:44	Catharina	yeah
2014-05-14 19:09:08	Leopejo	I won't read The God Delusion
2014-05-14 19:09:08	yosko	my parents believe in God but they're not observant jews
2014-05-14 19:09:25	Leopejo	and hi
2014-05-14 19:09:27	Catharina	unitarians don't actually believe in anything- there name is more historic than anything else.
2014-05-14 19:09:30	Catharina	their name*
2014-05-14 19:09:30	Catharina	wow
2014-05-14 19:09:36	Catharina	hi
2014-05-14 19:09:44	Catharina	unitarians covenant to practice seven principles
2014-05-14 19:09:46	Catharina	with one another
2014-05-14 19:09:52	yosko	the thing is that I was always unable to believe, even as I child I just didn't buy it :)
2014-05-14 19:10:07	yosko	but I deply respect people and their faiths whatever they may be
2014-05-14 19:10:09	Catharina	belief in everyone's worth, respect for one another, encouragement to growth and a bunch of other stuff
2014-05-14 19:10:27	Catharina	(unitarian principles)
2014-05-14 19:10:38	Catharina	i can't recite all seven off the top of my head
2014-05-14 19:11:02	Catharina	i respect faith because if i don't respect faith, i'm probably going to end up living in a cave
2014-05-14 19:11:24	yosko	yeah, and the idea is God is more linked to nature, gOD IS NATURE
2014-05-14 19:11:28	yosko	oops
2014-05-14 19:11:32	yosko	I like that
2014-05-14 19:12:50	Catharina	well, unitarianism was born out of a christian movement that said (1) there's no trinity (2) everyone is automatically going to heaven. because they said that, they ended up with a congregation that believed in whatever they wanted to believe. their historic basis is now just history, and it's a diverse accumulation of atheists, pagans, buddhists, christians, jews and people who just want a place to go on a sunday
2014-05-14 19:12:52	yosko	it's funny how believers don't consider atheist or people who don't believe in a definite God as spiritual ;)
2014-05-14 19:13:30	Catharina	it's similar to how the shakers said sex was sinful, and as an unintended consequence died out
2014-05-14 19:13:49	Catharina	yeah that is funny
2014-05-14 19:14:22	Catharina	unitarianism: no trinity. universalism: everyone goes to heaven
2014-05-14 19:14:29	yosko	yeah, religion or faith carried to the extreme
2014-05-14 19:14:48	yosko	what about jainism? :|
2014-05-14 19:14:59	Expug	Catharina: have you read about the gnostics...the catharians too (whatever they are called in English)
2014-05-14 19:15:18	Catharina	i've heard of them. i'm not a big christian scholar
2014-05-14 19:15:50	Catharina	the only reason i learned about unitarianism is because i've started going there for something to do on a sunday, since i don't watch sports
2014-05-14 19:15:51	Expug	yosko: the doctrine I follow, besides being Christian, had its basis in France (in spite of Brazil outnumbering it vastly now both in terms of adepts and books published), so one more connection to France
2014-05-14 19:16:13	yosko	what's it called, Expug?

2014-05-14 19:31:19	loulan	Tsundere (ツンデレ?, pronounced [tsɯndeɽe]) is a Japanese character development process that describes a person who is initially cold and even hostile towards another person before gradually showing their warm side over time.
2014-05-14 19:31:23	Leopejo	but now yosko loves me too, tseno

2014-05-14 19:33:17	Karavinka	classical tsundere is often hostile (and in fictional contexts, often violent) rather than just cold, though.

2014-05-14 19:49:27	yosko	I've had bad experiences with the translations of books by Lispetor, they're disastrous in French and the text loses its essence in English, they should be read in Portuguese
