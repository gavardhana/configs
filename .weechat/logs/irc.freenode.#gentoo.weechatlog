2015-04-12 08:28:30	zachary	do you mean in make.conf?
2015-04-12 08:28:45	zachary	package.use is for specific package
2015-04-12 08:28:51	binaryblade	no......
2015-04-12 08:30:07	zachary	my system does not have a pcakge.use file, but a directory instead
2015-04-12 08:31:52	binaryblade	etc:portage:package.use
2015-04-12 08:33:01	zachary	yes i fond package.use directory there. I THINK I CAN CREATE FILES In that directory
2015-04-12 08:33:14	binaryblade	yes you can
2015-04-12 08:33:21	binaryblade	organize them however you want
2015-04-12 08:33:46	zachary	thanks. package.license should be a file or directory?
2015-04-12 08:34:06	zachary	i cannot find file or directory in etc/protage/
2015-04-12 08:34:37	phunyguy	ok I finally got this.  :)
2015-04-12 08:34:41	phunyguy	Thanks for all the help, folks
2015-04-12 08:35:07	binaryblade	zachary: I though you just said you found the package.use directory
2015-04-12 08:35:23	zachary	yes. I found it.
2015-04-12 08:35:59	zachary	binaryblade: for package.license, there is no such file or directory. Aother issue
2015-04-12 08:36:32	binaryblade	I don't have that either
2015-04-12 08:37:12	kurly	per the man page, those files/directories only exist if you need them.  create them and be well.

2015-04-12 08:38:15	binaryblade	--autounmask-write is your friend
2015-04-12 08:38:26	binaryblade	and yes, directories are the prefered method

2015-04-12 08:38:56	binaryblade	also true, emerge supports both
2015-04-12 08:39:05	zachary	i think i can create a directory etc/portage/package.license, and then create specific file for specific package
2015-04-12 08:39:33	zachary	I do the same for package.use
2015-04-12 08:39:40	kurly	zachary: no, you know that, not think ;)
2015-04-12 08:40:30	zachary	kurly: thanks. I just not sure yet. But i have already done that.
2015-04-12 08:40:55	kurly	be one with the documentation! be sure! :D
2015-04-12 08:42:39	zachary	kurly & binaryblade: If currently, I use package.license file and input contents there, package installed correctly. Can I not change pakcage.license to directory and create new file under that?
2015-04-12 08:43:00	zachary	Can I now change pakcage.license to directory and create new file under that?

2015-04-14 21:55:18	+iamben	it's a bit silly that links actually installs an application desktop file to register itself as an http url handler, imho
2015-04-14 21:55:38	njsg	mark4_: I have no idea of how did that happen, perhaps that was the default for the xdg thing
2015-04-14 21:55:43	+iamben	but yeah it makes sense that if you remove it, another browser automatically takes precedence

2015-04-14 21:56:04	njsg	iamben: with this new desktop things, programs *must* install desktop files even if they are console programs, otherwise people can't use xdg-open and friends with it
2015-04-14 21:56:24	njsg	iamben: also, these programs will probably install desktop files so that they appear in the application menu of desktop environments

2015-04-14 21:57:06	grawity	wouldn't be very surprising if they also used elinks as primary browser
2015-04-14 21:57:08	mark4_	i wonder if thats why the midnight commander has an X use flag
2015-04-14 21:57:22	njsg	in fact, that's probably how all of this started, the desktop files were being used for the desktop environment menus
2015-04-14 21:57:41	+iamben	mark4_: the X flag is probably so it can interact better with GUI terminal emulators
2015-04-14 21:57:56	mark4_	arent desktop files a gnome invention?
2015-04-14 21:58:10	+iamben	njsg: that's exactly how it works, and they can specify mime types they handle
2015-04-14 21:58:31	njsg	mark4_: perhaps they were, nowadays they're part of new standards made by the guys at freedesktop
2015-04-14 21:58:35	mark4_	iamben hmm maybe. im terrified of any curses applications source code, ive implemented my own terminfo parser/text user interface.. i know what curses has to do lol
2015-04-14 21:58:36	+iamben	your xdg stuff already knows exactly which applications can handle http links, you just need to set a preference

2015-04-21 12:31:08	gentoob	But maybe it's because I banned the ip associated to the domain I guess.
2015-04-21 12:31:22	kerframil	gentoob: it looks highly suspect because 57055 is an ephemeral port, implying that the connection *originates* from your machine to the host in question

2015-04-26 09:38:35	yerodin	and sysresccd has a "installer" for creating the usb.
2015-04-26 09:38:36	DarkFox	kurly: Any reason for this recommendation? (I should have probably noted that I intend to install a hardened gentoo - pie, pax, etc)
2015-04-26 09:38:53	bazz_	Onime: yeah maybe not OK.. but what about blocking the package as epitamizor suggested?? Is that a sane strategy or could that pose problems down the road
2015-04-26 09:38:55	joral	it's looking like a broken dependency as the libs were not installed
2015-04-26 09:39:50	epitamizor	blocking means it just wont install, the worst that could happen  is that feature wont work
2015-04-26 09:39:52	bazz_	DarkFox: as I understand it, systemrescuecd is just more reliable in terms of booting.. after that installation is the same (chroot etc) .. I've never built FROM sysrescuecd myself so I can't comment further
2015-04-26 09:40:00	kurly	DarkFox: yes, it's just better ;) shouldn't affect your hardened install.
2015-04-26 09:40:28	kurly	use the hardened stage 3 and chroot in all the same

2015-04-26 15:16:52	psih0man	username234: but GPT is another story: if the disk is partitioned as GPT, the MBR (which is a small partition at the start of the device) may overwrite the first partition. also, it seems that I don't fully understand how grub works

In such a case, GRUB will install its stage1 to the MBR (like it alwys does), it's stage2 to the BIOS boot partition, and then access /boot from whatever partition /boot is installed on

2015-04-26 15:55:12	njsg	one way to see what is going on
2015-04-26 15:55:28	njsg	wpa_supplicant may actually associate instantly, but netifrc by design does that
2015-04-26 15:55:38	njsg	as it is wpa_supplicant that then calls netifrc again when it associates

2015-04-26 18:06:00	username234	vdevatman: that's because ~amd64 is not a USE flag
2015-04-26 18:06:11	vdevatman	wasn't it something like gcc --configure or eselect gcc list or something like that? I remember I used something like that at some point but can't remember
2015-04-26 18:06:12	anonymous2ch	I recommend to use ~amd64 globally if you need any non-stable packages
2015-04-26 18:06:16	abstr4kt	BtbN, do you know the right permission of /run/named? root:named 770 is correct?
2015-04-26 18:06:25	anonymous2ch	Just add ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~amd64" to your make.conf
2015-04-26 18:06:40	BtbN	Delete it, and the init script should re-create it propperly.

2015-04-26 18:07:14	Skunky	and i think that's a horrible idea and should done only when you absolutely must, because while it works most of the time, there are times your system will die and you have to be able to fix it yourself.
2015-04-26 18:07:32	anonymous2ch	you'll get lots of packages updated by using ~amd64

2015-04-26 18:51:12	SpudDogg	im trying to configure a bunch of servers to  use my rsync mirror, but i can't seem to get /etc/portage/repos.conf to work properly.  i've configured sync-type = rsync and syc-uri to rsync://hostnamehere/gentoo-portage, however an emerge --sync still tried to pull from a public server.  any ideas?
2015-04-26 18:51:21	exi	oznt, bc wicd calls the one you select and runs it ;)
2015-04-26 18:51:22	oznt	exi, ok, so it was ok. OK, let's say I stop wicd, start dhcpcd, how do I connect to a wpa network? I am walking in circles here

2015-04-28 22:33:02	jerichowasahoax	When I connect my ethernet NIC through NetworkManager, it enforces a default gateway of 192.168.2.1. This is detrimental, as that gateway has no Internet access. "sudo route del -net 0.0.0.0 gw 192.168.2.1" returns no error but does not actually remove the gateway, which leads me to believe NM is enforcing it somehow. How do I get it to quit that?

Better: create /etc/portage/package.mask and add '=foo-bar/package-x.y.z', this will mask that specific version (i.e. forbid Portage to install it) and the emerge this package again (or world-rebuild)

2015-05-04 16:30:12	rypervenche	After having upgraded to Gentoo Testing, I noticed that the recommended way to sync now is to use emaint sync -a and that using eix-sync can cause multiple syncs (found here https😕 /wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project😛 ortage/Sync#Operation ). When doing an emaint sync -a then an eix-update and eix-diff, it appears that the eix database doesn't get updated. I see that emerge --sync should actually call emaint sync
2015-05-04 16:30:14	rypervenche	-a now. Should I continue to use eix-sync?
2015-05-04 16:31:16	+grknight	rypervenche: continue to use eix-sync, just do not put anything in eix-sync.conf to have it sync using layman (the * or repo names)
2015-05-04 16:31:58	rypervenche	grknight: Great. I already made that change. Thank you. 😃 
2015-05-04 16:32:03	+grknight	rypervenche: you can do the sequence yourself, but you have to mv the old database prior to eix-update then eix-diff between old and new

2015-05-04 17:07:22	arvut	is it anyway related to ftp?
2015-05-04 17:07:26	+iamben	it's a horrible protocol, especially if there is any NAT or interesting firewall stuff, that's in addition to the total lack of security
2015-05-04 17:07:26	arvut	rypervenche: yes, I know that
2015-05-04 17:07:54	+iamben	tftp is a low-level protocol usually used for netboot stuff, not suitable for internet transfers

2015-05-04 17:11:33	+iamben	you can get sftp clients that act just like a normal ftp client, both CLI and gui
2015-05-04 17:11:39	need_to_setup_ww	i mean i dont have any connection to internet when I boot my first ever Gentoo install

I have heard that gentoo livecd ships with an installer now (http://www.softpedia.com/reviews/linux/Gentoo-Linux-LiveCD-18812.shtml) but I have no idea how to invoke it from root terminal and/or how to login as root (kdm prevents it). Is it still possible or rather only chroot installation is supported? I'm running recently downloaded AMD64 livecd.

2015-05-05 00:13:45	Kelsar	need_help_with: these are deltas to the snapshot, so you need the initial snapshot + delta
2015-05-05 00:13:56	Kelsar	depending who it is exactly done, all deltas
2015-05-05 00:14:02	need_help_with	the gentoo/snapshots/ directory seems to be for portage files and its subfolder seems to be an alternative:  deltas instead of full files

2015-05-05 00:15:10	Kelsar	need_help_with: well think of how it works, you download a snapshot and after that you use the deltas for X generations, then a new snapshot and deltas and so on.

2015-05-05 00:15:47	need_help_with	but how to use the ddeltas instead of downloading whole file every time?

You can either set "DISKLABEL=yes" in /etc/genkernel.conf or pass "--disklabel" during the creation of your initramfs, like this "genkernel --disklabel --kernel-config=/usr/src/linux/.config initramfs"

2015-05-08 11:57:33	sreich1	debdog: carogila: it is not enough to have /dev/sda2 mounte don /boot/efi for stub kernel to work, you need two folders /EFI/Boot on /dev/sda2. Which means if /dev/sda2 is mounted on /boot/efi, the complete path should read /boot/efi/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi

2015-05-08 15:59:53	SkunkyFone	metalhead33: use the tool in windos to do that...

2015-05-08 18:29:54	FL4SHK	As far as I know there's not much difference between the Linux kernel and the FreeBSD kernel.  Biggest difference I"m aware of is how parameters are passed to functions
2015-05-08 18:30:02	FL4SHK	IIRC BSD uses ONLY the stack, while Linux uses registers
2015-05-08 18:30:05	UNIXwz0r	iamben i have used it for a while i once done a YT Video on it and it was neat
2015-05-08 18:30:19	FL4SHK	Er, Linux uses registers and the stack if needed
2015-05-08 18:30:23	UNIXwz0r	to me i rather just use FreeBSD as it is to be honest

2015-05-08 18:30:50	UNIXwz0r	and gentoo is a linux system not BSD, but i like how they relate their system to a more FreeBSD  style system

2015-05-08 18:31:09	UNIXwz0r	like having everything in a port tree

2015-05-09 15:06:47	gentoo	hi i have an issue where i have wireless card support on the livedvd for gentoo but when i run my installed gentoo system it won't recognize my wireless
2015-05-09 15:07:20	Nia	Hi there, can someone check over this thread please? I've been trying to get libreoffice to stop crashing X for days now with no luck: https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7745126.html

2015-05-09 15:08:11	Nia	gentoo: You can try just about any livecd
2015-05-09 15:08:15	Prezident	Or well it works with wifi but its 10x easier solve it after the installation
2015-05-09 15:08:26	Nia	Gentoo can be installed with any livecd, or... almost any.
2015-05-09 15:09:16	gentoo	Why would I need an ethernet cable to install Gentoo? My question is why the livecd supports loads my wireless device's driver but my installed gentoo system doesn't.
2015-05-09 15:09:28	Nia	Perhaps try a more popular distro's livecd, it might have more wifi firmware loaded on it.
2015-05-09 15:09:46	King_DuckZ	I've been fighting with this damned kabini card since when I bought it one year ago - should I just buy a different netbook? is there no hope at all to get this machine to work properly?
2015-05-09 15:10:08	Nia	Oh, gentoo, you might need to enable your driver in your kernel.
2015-05-09 15:10:37	Nia	Either that or install some firmware for your specific card.
2015-05-09 15:10:52	gentoo	Nia, I loaded what I believe was the correct module using modprobe but it didn't work.
2015-05-09 15:11:14	Nia	Define "didn't work", that's pretty vague and doesn't give us anything to work with
2015-05-09 15:11:42	gentoo	My wireless device didn't appear in iwconfig and wasn't recognized by network manager.
2015-05-09 15:12:04	gentoo	But it does on the livecd of which I'm currently on.
2015-05-09 15:12:05	Nia	First thing's first, run ifconfig -a
2015-05-09 15:12:25	Nia	It'll list all network devices detected on the system.
2015-05-09 15:12:38	Nia	Up or not
2015-05-09 15:12:41	gentoo	I'm aware, it wasn't on there either.
2015-05-09 15:12:56	Nia	Then you didn't select the right driver
2015-05-09 15:13:00	Nia	In kernel.
2015-05-09 15:13:16	Nia	Or, you didn't enable the correct wireless options.
2015-05-09 15:13:37	gentoo	I used genkernel to make my kernel, it should have the same support the livedvd has, right?
2015-05-09 15:13:57	Nia	Go through the wireless networking section in the gentoo handbook and try wifi on the wiki

2015-05-09 19:23:16	bpkent	ibqn: from that link "The alx driver provide support for 1969:1091 - AR8161 Gigabit Ethernet"
2015-05-09 19:24:07	bpkent	ibqn: and that link was last updated 2 years ago ...
2015-05-09 19:24:15	ibqn	bpkent, but it#s not in gentoo-sources , right
2015-05-09 19:24:59	rypervenche	ibqn: Prompt: Qualcomm Atheros AR816x/AR817x support
2015-05-09 19:25:11	bpkent	ibqn: wrong under atheros there is CONFIG_ALX which is described as Qualcomm Atheros AR816x/AR817x support

2015-05-09 22:42:55	PhotoJim	rhombus: well first look up your device specs and see what you ought to get.  but to avoid caching affecting your results, I'd guess the best way would be to write a file much larger than your RAM would let you cache.
2015-05-09 22:43:12	PhotoJim	rhombus: e.g. if you have 32 MB of RAM, perhaps write a file of 64 MB to be sure caching isn't playing a role.

One option would be to download the firmware from another computer and then copy it into /lib/firmware, or use a different Linux install CD.  It really doesn't matter which Linux liveCD you use to install Gentoo.  I've used Ubuntu's in the past for issues like this.

2015-05-09 23:19:38	+grknight	Roland-: dunno the patches you are referring to.  Gentoo's packages use almost no distro patches for qemu, but it does have epatch_user which will let you apply any additional ones you want

2015-05-12 08:59:53	gfsh	there is an OEM-installed windows8 on this machine which shouldn't be removed or reinstalled, I shrinked the windows partition and made foom for a linux install, but I installed linux from 'legacy bios mode' since I couldn't get it to work from uefi, I've read somewhere that it's possible to convert the windows partition to uefi but there are no instructions on how to do that from linux
2015-05-12 09:00:28	gfsh	"to convert the windows partition to bios" that is ^^
2015-05-12 09:01:11	Angel_	gfsh, have you tried turning off UEFI in BIOS are am I thinking of something else?
2015-05-12 09:02:25	gfsh	Angel_: yes, I turned off UEFI, switched to 'legacy bios mode' in order to allow me to install another OS, even with secureboot disabled it didn't allow me or didn't succeed to install a grub2-efi

2015-05-13 01:50:31	orzel	Hello. I have a computer with an (integrated) r8169 device seen as enp2s0 by the kernel. I've added a pci-e ethernet card, which happens to be also a r8169, and took the name enp2s0. The previous one is now called enp2s0. Is there a way to tell the kernel to give enp2s0 to the integrated one (as before) ? I dont mean using udev rules or such, really something depending only on the kernel
2015-05-13 01:50:56	orzel	the previous one is called "enp3s0", sorry :)

2015-05-14 01:07:55	bpkent	coffee88: understandable.  I think portage is saying this "<=sys-apps/sysvinit-2.88-r4 required by (sys-power/apcupsd-3.14.8-r2:0/0::gentoo, installed)" is the problem, though when i try to install sys-power/apcupsd it doesn't complain about sysvinit being sys-apps/sysvinit-2.88-r7, perhaps you can help portage by widening the dep check with: emerge -puDvU --autounmask=n --with-bdeps=y --complete-graph=y @world

2015-05-14 10:30:33	pa1983	raid0 with ext4 and rtorrent any one have any experience with that? Pros and cons?
2015-05-14 10:32:13	@xiaomiao	pa1983: raid0 survives zero drive failures
2015-05-14 10:32:29	@xiaomiao	apart from that I'd expect it to work quite well
2015-05-14 10:33:38	kerframil	pa1983: raid0 is unsafe, obviously. xfs may scale better if you're doing heavy concurrent I/O and you won't have to worry about running out of inodes. ext4 is still decent, though.
2015-05-14 10:33:39	pa1983	xiaomiao, well that I know but its for torrenting only so I would only loos what ever I have not achieved
2015-05-14 10:34:20	@xiaomiao	kerframil: for 'large' files I'd expect the performance difference to be relatively negligible
2015-05-14 10:34:23	pa1983	my problem is not that my current drive is not fast enough for 100/100Mbit the problem is when I archive and it runs flat out on at 100Mbit both ways. Then rtorrent crawls to a halt

2015-05-14 10:35:19	@xiaomiao	kerframil: well, it did have some issues a decade ago ... but after ~3 years of stressing it I only lost data through hardware failure
2015-05-14 10:35:28	@xiaomiao	which definitely isn't XFS's problem
2015-05-14 10:35:31	pa1983	People tell me they dont use raid0 for torrenting since its random read/write (I know that to) but I fugured since EXT4 supports prealocation in sequential order and rtorrent supports that feature in EXT4 well comparing it to "windows" like most do migth no be fair.

2015-05-15 01:05:28	+iamben	Treah_Work: if you do "emerge -uDNav world" it should offer to rebuild virtual/udev and a few other things, it shouldn't pull static-dev

2015-05-15 01:06:36	+iamben	if you wanna do a few less builds right now, you can just use the base systemd profile temporarily

2015-05-18 20:07:41	joe9	 compile a kernel with only allmodconfig, it does not work well (no serial console, keyboard does not work in initramfs shell, and the disks on lvm cannot be recognised or mounted)
2015-05-18 20:07:58	joe9	 I am trying to figure out how to debug this. Generally, When there is an issue, I tend to use the approach of commenting half the file and trying, if it still does not work, comment out another half and so on.
2015-05-18 20:08:08	joe9	 I cannot figure out how to use that approach when debugging the kernel configuration.
2015-05-18 20:08:18	joe9	 The different options between defconfig and allmodconfig is so many and in so many places, I cannot figure out how to use defconfig for half of the configuration and allmodconfig for another half of the configuration.
2015-05-18 20:08:40	joe9	 this is my allmod.config http://codepad.org/kWYZLwpg and it is getting unweildy as I add more disabled options.

2015-05-18 20:25:21	kerframil	joe9: in particular, consider the implications of 'all*' vs 'local*'. the former implies that almost everything will be a module, which doesn't sound useful to me.

2015-05-18 20:26:08	blackworker	i have a question to keyword ABI_X86
2015-05-18 20:26:21	kerframil	joe9: it should try to base the enabled options on the modules that have actually been loaded to support your hardware in the current environment, as I understand it
2015-05-18 20:26:21	joe9	kerframil: localmodconfig works fine.

2015-05-18 20:27:18	kerframil	joe9: alternatively, and I'm speculating, but allmodconfig followed by localyesconfig should work better than your original approach. I'd imagine the config would be rather bloated though.

2015-05-18 20:41:12	kerframil	blackworker: well, yes. so recompile them
2015-05-18 20:41:31	kerframil	blackworker: it will do it for you. you just need to apply the proposed package.* changes.
2015-05-18 20:41:43	kerframil	blackworker: I see. well, it's your call.

2015-05-18 20:41:51	+iamben	depends on whether you want to save a bit of human time up front at the expense of an ongoing cpu-time burden, or not
2015-05-18 20:41:58	kerframil	blackworker: you seem to be more interested in saving time, so having portage queue the package.use changes is your shortest route.
2015-05-18 20:42:08	blackworker	okay, thx kerframil for your knowledge
2015-05-18 20:42:33	blackworker	kerframil, i am interesting to keep my package.use as simple as possible :)
2015-05-18 20:42:55	blackworker	i want to avoid there 1000 entires, just because of that

2015-05-18 20:43:14	kerframil	blackworker: I can certainly appreciate that. another strategy is to contain related batches of changes in files within package.use/ as a directory. you can also use wildcards e.g. x11-libs/* abi_x86_32

2015-05-18 20:49:39	blackworker	okay, so whatever config-file is in /etc/portage/package.use/ , portage will consider it before installing any package
2015-05-18 20:49:49	blackworker	so thats might the best idea in my case
2015-05-18 20:50:10	kerframil	blackworker: you can have as many files as you like. they will be processed collectively, in lexical order.

2015-05-22 20:50:52	litwol	grknight: not much about replication changes with GTID. for example master-master is still hell. what it does offer is an incredibly easy slave-to-master promotion and topology propagation across your cluster. previously you had to script promoting slaves to make the process easy updating old slaves to new master.. now that process is super simple and very fast.
2015-05-22 20:50:57	litwol	that's about it :)
2015-05-22 20:51:27	rivarun	and then there are modules which only make sense as external. and one day you will want to unload or reload something and you'll be SOL

2015-05-22 21:30:58	litwol	kerframil: it looks to me much simpler if backup process can be done outside of db application. stop slave. snapshot fs. start slave. after that you can backup the snapshot itself, or the increment of it.
2015-05-22 21:31:00	blaise	games-action/minetest is in need of a bump....
2015-05-22 21:31:09	kerframil	litwol: no, and it never will. the xfs developers are very clear on that. they're not interested in solving those problems within the filesystem layer. the attraction of XFS is that it has a good balance of performance, stability and scalability. as far as I can gather, it's preferred by those who run MySQL at scale.

2015-05-29 20:31:33	B0BBY	iamben: yeah, I thought so. 12+ hours for a package that has a history of 30 min. I guess I'll do a revdep-rebuild, --depclean and give it another go.

2015-05-29 20:32:26	B0BBY	grknight: ok, once I run the emerge again and glibc starts building and gets in a loop, I will use only qlop -c to find out what package is being built.
2015-05-29 20:32:45	B0BBY	grknight: and hopefully I can determine if it's the same package stuck for long time of if the packge names are changing overtime.

2015-05-30 10:52:27	joral	when 3.0 released I read an article about the naming change but that has been a while, It seems like they referenced the numerous changes of 2.6 and were like, we have to get better about advancing the versioning more consistently.  not saying they didn't rubber band it the other way, but they at least haven't just left it the same number with microversions being completely different

Thus not building radeonfb un-breaks radeon, but also doesn't provide the I2C drivers to properly communicate with the card.

And last but certainly not least Disabling KMS (via any one of the dependencies) properly loads radeonfb which cant process X11 color scheme correctly resulting in blue, so much blue.

2015-05-30 11:22:30	joral	njsg, all of the answers are to use nomodeset to disable KMS.  The problem is that every distro dropped support for PPC prior to the modern drivers with KMS, thus there are no developers to report it to.

But, I am building the initramfs every time with updated mdadm.conf and fstab. I am trying to figure out how your initramfs works without those 2 files. Also, Would you mind sharing your initrd script, please? I am sure I can learn a lot from reading it.

2015-06-02 11:30:59	krosos	meh
2015-06-02 11:31:02	krosos	okay, thanks
2015-06-02 11:31:21	theShirbiny	krosos:: I think there's a flag to force using openrc instead of systemd for gnome-shell
2015-06-02 11:31:22	krosos	i'll just use awesome on that computer again
2015-06-02 11:31:25	Mad3	(but really, do try systemd again..)
2015-06-02 11:32:35	Mad3	a system booting in less than a second between bios and login screen, and declarative service syntax are great
2015-06-02 11:33:02	krosos	i did *not* want another systemd advertisment, thanks.

I just prefer to not use it because things already existed which performed well enough. but i think rational discussions about systemd are difficult and i don't want to start one, just my 2cents for the systemd lines.

2015-06-03 12:01:39	moltonel	The fii-yajl doc say "USE_SYSTEM_LIBYAJL2 can be set before installing or bundling libyajl2"

2015-06-03 12:03:09	moltonel	Hum... maybe I read those docs wrong, USE_SYSTEM_LIBYAJL2 is to be set for another gem.
2015-06-03 12:03:43	cay	kiuma: youre stable (KEYWORDS=amd64/x86) ?
2015-06-03 12:04:04	cay	if so just install x11-drivers/xf86-video-modesetting
2015-06-03 12:04:48	kiuma	cay, i'm with stable backages: is 1.17.* stable enought ?
2015-06-03 12:05:41	moltonel	fii-yajl uses libyajl2-gem which "gem to install the libyajl2 c-library for distributions which do not have it" but I'd still need that gem even though I want to use the system's lib. Gotta love ruby gems...
2015-06-03 12:06:53	cay	kiuma: if youre with stable just get x11-drivers/xf86-video-modesetting, switching to unstable (~amd64) probably will pull you more unstable things (i prefer either full system stable or unstable)

2015-06-05 00:55:40	stanley	infinmed: always go native because gcc will auto detect your platform, but i'm sure that one is pretty close/it :)
2015-06-05 00:55:49	stanley	just make sure your CPU flags are set in both of those variables
2015-06-05 00:55:55	infinmed	Alright
2015-06-05 00:56:05	stanley	infinmed: I use cpuinfo2cpuflags-x86 to generate, include it, then USE="${USE} ${CPU_FLAGS_X86}" underneath my normal USE and the newly-added CPU_FLAGS_X86 so that older ebuilds that haven't yet moved will still pick up all the flags
2015-06-05 00:56:19	df21	Wait
2015-06-05 00:56:20	infinmed	So I should have 'bdver2' in USE
2015-06-05 00:56:28	df21	didnt the first release of bulldozer have issues
2015-06-05 00:56:39	stanley	infinmed: no, I mean the CPU flags like avx, etc
2015-06-05 00:56:52	stanley	emerge cpuinfo2cpuflags then cpuinfo2cpuflags-x86 will generate it. then follow instructions as above
2015-06-05 00:56:58	infinmed	Pj O jave a few pf err.. Oh I have a few of those. Not all of them that it supports
2015-06-05 00:57:01	 *	infinmed looks what he has
2015-06-05 00:57:30	infinmed	CPU_FLAGS_X86="aes avx fma3 fma4 mmx mmxext popcnt sse sse2 sse3 sse4_1 sse4_2 sse4a ssse3 xop"
2015-06-05 00:57:33	stanley	using that script will tell you which your CPU supports. then put them into CPU_FLAGS_X86 as ^ says. don't modify the output of the script
2015-06-05 00:57:36	stanley	yup
2015-06-05 00:57:36	infinmed	And then -march=bdver2 in CFLAGS
2015-06-05 00:58:10	stanley	infinmed: add that to make.conf, then underneath that and your USE: USE="${USE} ${CPU_FLAGS_X86}"
2015-06-05 00:58:20	infinmed	Actually it wasn't bulldozer one even that did the high performance jump for that specific architecture opcode set, it was the one before it, i forget what it was called.. barcelona maybe?
2015-06-05 00:58:36	infinmed	looking at benchmarks that's how it seems to be, anyways

2015-06-05 00:59:08	+floppym	stanley: I think all ebuilds in the gentoo repostory were updated, so that hack is only useful for stale overlays.
2015-06-05 00:59:47	stanley	floppym: I do it just in case, but that's interesting. The reason why I still do it is because most of the wiki guides mention USE=..., not CPU_FLAGS_X86, so I worry that some maintainer will go back to that
2015-06-05 00:59:53	stanley	i'll have to find a way to check that out

2015-06-08 21:58:06	mijenix	what is missing here?: encode? ( x264? ( gpl ) xvid? ( gpl ) X? ( !xcb? ( gpl ) ) )
2015-06-08 21:58:21	AzP	I'm trying to port an ebuild to multilib, but I just can't get it to work. When it tries to compile it just stops since there is nothing to do. I think it is because of multilib_copy_sources not working, so the Makefile is missing in the multilib build directory (they are empty as far as I can tell).

2015-06-12 10:20:59	Zaister	oops double pasted this
2015-06-12 10:21:02	kurly	seems a new version has been released and not added to portage yet
2015-06-12 10:21:16	kurly	usually takes less than 24h
2015-06-12 10:21:34	Zaister	ok then
2015-06-12 10:21:47	kurly	google immediately deletes all previous versions when releasing a new one, and it is not legal for gentoo to mirror
2015-06-12 10:21:55	Zaister	ah ok
2015-06-12 10:21:55	kurly	so unfortunately this is the best that can be done
2015-06-12 10:22:05	Zaister	is there a way to see the current version?
2015-06-12 10:22:13	Zaister	the number i mean
2015-06-12 10:22:22	kurly	on google's end, or gentoo's?

2015-06-12 10:22:36	renergy	kurly: "usually 24h" (I concur!), but in the case of xmp module player - more than 3 years
2015-06-12 10:22:48	kurly	renergy: completely unrelated
2015-06-12 10:22:52	renergy	I know
2015-06-12 10:23:02	renergy	sorry for intruding, just wanted to ask
2015-06-12 10:23:18	steveeJ	kurly: indeed python-updater didn't want to install a single package. what is it you would rebuild? python or the single packages?
2015-06-12 10:23:43	kurly	renergy: heh I'm not a developer, couldn't help you if I wanted.  check bugs.gentoo.org for active/inactive bugs?
2015-06-12 10:24:06	kurly	steveeJ: I'd think 'emerge -a1v python:2.7' but that's mostly a guess
2015-06-12 10:24:20	renergy	kurly: I filed a bug, but the developer does not seem to care - I would like to ask about some "canonical" procedure in this case
2015-06-12 10:24:20	steveeJ	unfortunately I've tried that without success
2015-06-12 10:24:37	kurly	renergy: bug #what

2015-06-12 13:14:45	Valuial	mahmoud: yea - but routing is nontrivial. especially if parts are down the other parts trying to compensate can make things weird and unpredictable.
2015-06-12 13:14:47	mahmoud	maybe internet routers need to perform more analysis before replacing routes with a seemingly-better route

2015-06-12 15:51:22	+iamben	saren: that 2MB unformatted space is so the grub stage1 code that can't fit in the 446 byte boot sector can spill over

2015-06-14 08:42:47	kurly	how often is one websyncing that the download of 70MB is "too slow"?
2015-06-14 08:43:31	marschw	if you're behind a firewall that allows only http, always
2015-06-14 08:44:14	kurly	what?
2015-06-14 08:45:09	marschw	it's common for firewalls to block most ports, including rsync.  so, the only way to sync portage is via http
2015-06-14 08:45:22	kurly	and what does that have to do with download speed?

2015-06-14 08:47:07	+bonsaikitten	telius: if you still have that slow speed nothing would fix it
2015-06-14 08:47:21	+bonsaikitten	telius: and a tool like axel would only annoy, and not actually speed it up
2015-06-14 08:47:32	+bonsaikitten	so what's the point of MOAR KONNEKTIUNZ
2015-06-14 08:47:38	marschw	kurly, because that means the download takes place over a single tcp connection.  for certain network links (e.g. high bdp and bad windowing), multi-threading the download can increase speed a lot
2015-06-14 08:48:04	telius	I wasn't arguing for axel or anything
2015-06-14 08:48:21	kurly	marschw: sounds like you should fix your network rather than abuse the volunteered mirror network
2015-06-14 08:48:22	telius	I was saying that the most it should take, is four minutes, when you're probably not there, which isn't a lot

2015-06-14 08:50:33	kurly	indeed
2015-06-14 08:50:34	+bonsaikitten	that should then saturate your connection badly
2015-06-14 08:50:39	+bonsaikitten	of course, using mirrorselect is easier
2015-06-14 08:50:43	+bonsaikitten	but where's the fun in that
2015-06-14 08:51:37	marschw	apokatastasis, when you're at a location that has high latency and high bandwidth, your bandwidth may be limited by hitting tcp windowing limits while packets have not yet been acked.  a workaround for this is to use multiple tcp connections, effectively increasing your windowing size

2015-06-14 12:35:50	EvilPudding	I dont think I ever did this
2015-06-14 12:35:50	grawity	rx80: this is grub, not kernel, do you even get a choice
2015-06-14 12:36:10	Yatekii	well rx80 that was not extended ^^ I will rebuild the kernel later, but for now it has to suffice
2015-06-14 12:36:45	EvilPudding	ppklom_: ls -a ~ is there anything chrome there?
2015-06-14 12:37:01	rx80	grawity: i have no clue what you mean. grub has built in support
2015-06-14 12:37:16	grawity	it does
2015-06-14 12:37:23	grawity	but said support is in form of a grub module
2015-06-14 12:37:47	rx80	grawity: not even for btrfs, i never had a need to specify grub modules
2015-06-14 12:38:04	grawity	because grub-upadte or whatever detects them automatically, most of the time
2015-06-14 12:38:22	rx80	grawity: ah, that's why. so, the answer to Yatekii is "no"
2015-06-14 12:38:42	kurly	superlinux-hp: did you not read anything from earlier? :\
2015-06-14 12:38:43	grawity	or, I dunno, I haven't /used/ grub in a while, but I know for sure that it has ext2.mod, fat.mod, btrfs.mod, and all that
2015-06-14 12:38:54	kurly	superlinux-hp: because you're asking questions that have already been answered
2015-06-14 12:38:58	Yatekii	rx80: why no? how can it read my ext4 if I have no ext4 support? :S
2015-06-14 12:39:06	rx80	Yatekii: if you're building a minimal kernel, you're fine with making a kernel with no modules at all, everything can be built in
2015-06-14 12:39:07	grawity	and I guess ext2.mod also handles ext4
2015-06-14 12:39:20	rx80	Yatekii: it auto-loads if needed
2015-06-14 12:39:26	Yatekii	ok
2015-06-14 12:39:35	Yatekii	well i don't get it anymore it just wont find my root :(

2015-06-14 13:48:15	thican	Kind of annoyed, I lost around 30 min because in portage(5), the repertory is not "/etc/portage/profiles/", but without the "s" …
2015-06-14 13:48:17	rx80	EvilPudding: o nice, and warm
2015-06-14 13:48:20	toralf	eroen: app-admin/sysstat installs /usr/share/doc/sysstat-11.0.5/sargraph.bz2 but not sargraph itself (which BRDEPENDs on gnonme-extra/zenity)

2015-06-14 13:48:33	thican	Well, ok, it's just a typo

2015-06-14 13:49:25	+perfinion	lol that sounds annoying, yes file a bug
2015-06-14 13:50:56	thican	on my way, but is it a "Hosted Project", or a "Documentation"?
2015-06-14 13:51:07	rx80	Documentation
2015-06-14 13:51:09	thican	ok
2015-06-14 13:53:02	rx80	thican: which man page did you read?
2015-06-14 13:53:08	rx80	thican: man portage? man ebuild?
2015-06-14 13:53:14	thican	portage(5)
2015-06-14 13:53:25	EvilPudding	Im curious, Im pretty familiar on how to develop for the linux kernel, because its git, and I know git, if I wanted to fix a bug on gentoo, is there any way to email a diff to be merged?
2015-06-14 13:53:29	thican	I was creating the use.stable.mask file
2015-06-14 13:53:34	grawity	EvilPudding: git send-email
2015-06-14 13:53:51	EvilPudding	grawity: gentoo uses git?
2015-06-14 13:54:02	rx80	thican: ah, thank you, i see it :)
2015-06-14 13:54:49	thican	by the way, I am not sure to understand why we can't create use.{,stable.}mask directly into the root of the portage configuration directory, but I guess there is a reason
2015-06-14 13:56:18	rx80	thican: i think it's because those things are per-profile
2015-06-14 13:56:24	thican	just … loosing 30 min for a typo in the doc … I get mad for myself to my own typo, but this time, I really check, until I search exactly the bug 551104 comment 2

2015-06-15 14:44:23	XwZ	yes, when I start alsamixer the default card is PA
2015-06-15 14:44:38	Maitreya	i have -pulseaudio on my systems and i have the same "bug"
2015-06-15 14:44:44	XwZ	and I do have a pulseaudio process
2015-06-15 14:44:46	BtbN	configure the card via PA
2015-06-15 14:44:48	BtbN	and not via alsa
2015-06-15 14:45:00	BtbN	if you modify it via alsa, of course PA won't notice
2015-06-15 14:45:07	Maitreya	pulse will use alsa so it will still not output sound after "mute"
2015-06-15 14:45:32	Maitreya	XwZ: is it a intel hd sound card?

2015-06-15 14:45:42	Maitreya	yeah same thing here
2015-06-15 14:45:58	Maitreya	suspect it got something to do with auto powersave on mute and then not unmute on volume up
2015-06-15 14:46:07	XwZ	I will look how to set my cards setting usin PA then, do you have any software name ?

Then you reboot, and EFI gives you a prompt like "Gentoo Linux has asked to install a new signing root with fingerprint AB:CD:EF..: Authorize? Yes/No" -- but of course we don't have that

2015-06-19 20:08:46	pekster	It should "just work" with confirmation of fingerprints, and an opt-in switch required for CA updates

2015-06-28 08:38:54	tzero	konsolebox: so the 64-bit gcc can cross-compile 32-bit binaries?

2015-06-28 08:41:45	tzero	yup hehe
2015-06-28 08:44:33	tzero	hardmode is fun :)
2015-06-28 08:44:35	konsolebox	tzero: does this 32bit qt have to be part of your main system as well? if not, try chroot?
2015-06-28 08:45:06	tzero	konsolebox: nah, I'm just creating it for a self-contained skype install; I don't want to have to muck around with adding over 9000 abi_x86 use flags and installing all the deps to /
2015-06-28 08:45:41	konsolebox	tzero: well, 32-bit qt would still need 32-bit deps not?
2015-06-28 08:45:50	tzero	yep
2015-06-28 08:46:10	konsolebox	tzero: so it's the same as using abi_x86_32 on every package where it's needed
2015-06-28 08:46:46	konsolebox	tzero: maybe you were thinking of using abi_x86_32 globally? that's so wrong :)
2015-06-28 08:46:46	tzero	except I'm doing it outside of portage, so the USE flags don't do anything
2015-06-28 08:46:57	rafd	tzero: 64-bit GCC can indeed compile 32-bit binaries
2015-06-28 08:47:22	tzero	it's probably just a matter of fussing with qt's configure script; I found these -host-arch and -arch parameters, which look promising
2015-06-28 08:47:29	rafd	tzero: it’s done (probably in the multilib eclass) by adding -m32
2015-06-28 08:47:34	tzero	hmm
2015-06-28 08:48:03	konsolebox	tzero: if you do it outside of portage, where would you place the 32bit dependencies then?
2015-06-28 08:48:19	rafd	konsolebox: presumably /usr/local/lib32
2015-06-28 08:48:29	konsolebox	rafd: that could f the system :)

2015-06-28 08:53:24	konsolebox	tzero: if you plan to place everything in $HOME/skype-standalone or /opt/skype-standalone, you would need to have a local configuration of /etc/ld.so.conf* to make it really self-contained so the added lib path to /opt/skype-standalone/lib* would not be in conflict with the main system. that which i don't how you would be able to do

2015-06-28 19:26:22	rypervenche	JonDDox: There is a bit of a learning curve, and you will learn about tools that can help you make your Gentoo journey easier and faster, like eix, elogv, dispatch-conf, etc.
2015-06-28 19:26:23	JonDDox	not in knowlegde, but in my mind

I'm noticing a trend in that 90% of the time I experience nontrivial dependency hell, it's various unicode-capable applications arguing about whether certain libraries should/shouldn't use the icu compile flag (Internationalization Components for Unicode)...chromium's, calibre's, and pandoc's dependency trees are most-common offenders.  As none of those three are unpopular packages, I was wondering

2015-06-28 23:27:55	bitbyte	means efi wont work and you have to legacey boot
2015-06-28 23:28:06	Kelsar	bitbyte: wrong

2015-06-28 23:29:03	arvut	nah, I rarely do xD

2015-06-28 23:32:41	bitbyte	only legacey boot with grub2

2015-06-28 23:33:01	arvut	if it has "legacy bios" mode then it is a efi bios
2015-06-28 23:33:07	Kelsar	undrwater1: yes, you need proc and dev
2015-06-28 23:33:13	arvut	that's what my bios is set to

2015-06-28 23:33:51	arvut	bitbyte: its not an option, its a option to turn off efi by enabling legacy mode
2015-06-28 23:34:04	Kelsar	what do you expect? is there something called CSM?
2015-06-28 23:34:13	Kelsar	bitbyte: they have it since ages
2015-06-28 23:34:33	Kelsar	bitbyte: it is just a boot option

2015-06-28 23:35:42	Kelsar	arvut: efi needs a bootloader, like the stub option in the kernel
2015-06-28 23:35:55	arvut	oh
2015-06-28 23:35:56	Kelsar	but efi can read a fat partition to execute efi binarys

2015-06-28 23:36:30	Kelsar	arvut: yes
2015-06-28 23:36:30	arvut	so its simply a faster boot then

2015-06-28 23:37:02	Kelsar	with drivers and applications
2015-06-28 23:37:08	arvut	either way, legacy mode bios on a fairly new mobo is faster than most humans, you barely have time to sit down before it starts your kernel

2015-06-28 23:52:00	arvut	also, I've noticed that this 64bit game is using only core, maxing it out, think it could be told to use more cores
2015-06-28 23:52:10	arvut	maybe that's a game config feature tho
2015-06-28 23:52:12	Kelsar	arvut: only if it is programmed to do so

2015-06-28 23:53:52	arvut	its just very cpu heavy when loading first game, and its been getting slower and slower the last few months, probably too much game content to process
2015-06-28 23:53:57	arvut	I think its unpacking

2015-07-05 00:36:15	draven	Hello people! I have a really really sh!tty question but since it might be gentoo related...here it is: I am trying to get xftalpha working in Conky. It's been all day i am trying any kind of setting without luck, and google didn't helped. I compiled conky with xft and have USE=truetype in my make.conf. I am using compton as a comp-manager and did not set any kind of exclusion rule for Conky. Can you please
2015-07-05 00:36:21	draven	 give me any kind of advice? I am working on a bigass conky project and i NEED that xftalpha :/. If my question here is inapropriate, please excuse me and ignore this.

2015-07-05 00:38:07	memleak	i use tar for pretty much all back ups unless it's like a regular thing, then i use bacula
2015-07-05 00:38:36	Goonzu	i still want to be able to access it and read and write etc..
2015-07-05 00:39:31	memleak	that's what a backup does, it allows you to read and write to your files after data is destroyed
2015-07-05 00:39:56	memleak	it wouldn't be much of a backup if you just lose everything
2015-07-05 00:40:56	Goonzu	memleak: :P  hmm  either you misunderstood me or I you or i suck at explaining ^__^
2015-07-05 00:41:11	memleak	"best way to move 1.4TB of data to another disk?" best is an opinion
2015-07-05 00:41:41	memleak	"basically i have 1.4tb of parition on ntfs that i need to keep to new drive of 3TB" you can copy partitions over using "dd" or "dc3dd"
2015-07-05 00:42:18	memleak	dc3dd has data verification with FBI certified approval to find your CP
2015-07-05 00:42:30	+NeddySeagoon	memleak: not really.  dd does a block level copy -  you don't want that
2015-07-05 00:42:47	memleak	my first suggestion was tar
2015-07-05 00:43:10	memleak	but that wasn't good enough, someone said don't use rsync so i'm mentioning other things like dd, dc3dd and bacula
2015-07-05 00:43:34	+NeddySeagoon	memleak: you need something that preserves ntfs file permissions
2015-07-05 00:43:43	memleak	I'm sure everyone here has their own vandetta against copy methods with not two people that can agree on the same method.

2015-07-05 09:13:57	x1	The pragmatism of ArchLinux has advantages over Gentoo. Their community is much more prolific (evidenced by number and age of packages)
2015-07-05 09:14:43	jwm224	I think anything you put time into you'll appriciate more. Plus, you're customizing an operating system that caiters to your system as well as your own needs. For me, it doesn't get much better.

2015-07-05 10:21:25	njsg	the trickiest part at some point was pairing. with some change in bluez, as well as USE flags, you had to turn on testing programs to get a pairing utility
2015-07-05 10:21:39	deathlire	ok i think i see your audio prob..
2015-07-05 10:21:47	njsg	I don't know if it still has a pairing utility, bluez is sadly part of the "let's just make a dbus backend for DEs" crowd

2015-07-05 10:29:47	hummerpaskaa	rx80: Think I might have figured out the problem. I was root when I started alsamixer. When I start it as my user I only see pulseaudio again. So I assume that is because I am not in the audio group, but again, all guides say I shouldnt be
2015-07-05 10:29:49	zachary	njsg: i want to know what services are supported by bluez and obexfs.
2015-07-05 10:29:55	deathlire	media-libs/alsa-lib, media-plugins/alsa-plugins, media-plugins/gst-plugins-alsa, media-sound/alsa-utils are the only alsa things i have installed on my system..since i use pulseaudio..
2015-07-05 10:30:11	rx80	hummerpaskaa: i told you before, and deathlire told you as well

2015-07-05 13:52:17	deathlire	that sandbox is probably an overlay..
2015-07-05 13:52:37	wraeth_	|read|: then you may also need the argument 'dolvm' added to the cmdline - read the genkernel wiki: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Genkernel

2015-07-05 14:12:43	deathlire	but far as getting to ports for irc..depending on your router..perhaps you could even flash it with dd-wrt openwrt or tomato..but most likely you need to port forward you internal ip..to 6667 and 6697 outgoing..and it might let you connect

2015-07-05 14:26:31	deathlire	depends on what it is..and chna has some strict isp's..so a dns change may let it through unless they have a box setting in front filtering those connections..but usually it wold say no route to host..instead of hanging..unless it was done on purpose

2015-07-09 17:48:54	+iamben	leventel: did you set CONFIG_IWLWIFI=m and CONFIG_IWLDVM=m and did you emerge linux-firmware?
2015-07-09 17:49:08	+iamben	it's important that they be modules, not built-in
2015-07-09 17:49:11	leventel	... I found Intel "section" in Wireless LAN in menuconfig, but I tried almost all Intel wireless drivers and that didn't work
2015-07-09 17:49:28	rbrooks_	re the udev 217 change does that mean that drivers req. firmware may now be modules anytime?
2015-07-09 17:49:32	leventel	iamben: hm, that's a problem :)
2015-07-09 17:49:55	rbrooks_	or no
2015-07-09 17:50:28	+iamben	leventel: if you want them built-in, you must also set CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE="" with a list of all required firmwares so they can be baked into the kernel @ build time
2015-07-09 17:50:50	+iamben	rbrooks_: nothing has changed about modules vs built-in there

2015-07-09 18:02:19	rx80	rbrooks_: if you don't use native, it just uses a more generic subset of instructions that work on all x64 machines
2015-07-09 18:02:30	rbrooks_	yeah so its bloat :(
2015-07-09 18:02:37	rbrooks_	or not really so bad?

2015-07-09 18:03:51	rbrooks_	okay cool that...  why wont distcc inferit the native flags from the system that started the compile?
2015-07-09 18:04:12	rbrooks_	s/inferit/inherit/
2015-07-09 18:04:17	rx80	rbrooks_: because it's not made that way. but it's easy to specify what your system uses
2015-07-09 18:04:36	+iamben	distcc doesn't know how to expand native to an explicit value
2015-07-09 18:04:47	rbrooks_	ok i get it so you are saying I probably should hard code it rather than depend on 'native'?
2015-07-09 18:04:48	+iamben	gcc does, but you need to coax that info out of gcc
2015-07-09 18:05:10	+iamben	^ yeah just use the appropriate explicit value, -march=core-avx2 or whatever
2015-07-09 18:05:14	rx80	even that line that most people paste and use is overkill, too many flags that doesn't change anything
2015-07-09 18:05:36	rbrooks_	hmm okay cool I want to try it out because compile times arte very slow :)
2015-07-09 18:05:53	+iamben	rx80: yeah i hate it when people take that whole gcc line as-is rather than just grabbing the march
2015-07-09 18:06:02	wraeth	use the following command to see exactly what flags -march=native sets

2015-07-09 20:36:57	+iamben	layman -a is to add the overlay itself;  once the overlay is added, you emerge packages from it like normal

2015-07-10 11:04:01	CMEPTb	no.. i meant if there wasn't checksumming, since this is all compiled, that would also fail probably .. so unlike bin distros and win like things, you wouldn't end up with a bin that will fail in certain conditions.
2015-07-10 11:04:44	rx80	CMEPTb: if there wasn't checking, it wouldn't necessarily fail.
2015-07-10 11:04:54	rx80	CMEPTb: the bad bit could be in some text, or firmware

2015-07-10 11:06:05	rx80	CMEPTb: yes, but you could also end up with something that compiles, and installs, but works in a horrible way, or wipes everything :)

2015-07-10 20:55:27	Leno	     According wikipedia,  ppc64le is a pure little endian mode that's been introduced with the POWER8
2015-07-10 20:55:27	Leno	as the prime target for the OpenPOWER Foundation based technologies, trying to enable porting of x86
2015-07-10 20:55:27	Leno	 Linux based software with minimal effort.
2015-07-10 20:55:27	Leno	     An idea suddenly came in my mind" Why NOT let's gentoo support little endian powerpc?"  And advantages
2015-07-10 20:55:27	Leno	as followed:
2015-07-10 20:55:27	Leno	1. enable porting x86 Linux based application with minimal effort.
2015-07-10 20:55:27	Leno	2. Some PowerPC user, little endian apparently feels cheap, wrong, and PCish.
2015-07-10 20:55:28	Leno	3. Other distrbutions like Ubuntu, Redhat and SUSE already support little endian in powerpc.
2015-07-10 20:55:28	Leno	4. Many distrbutions are based on gentoo, like ChromeOS, CoreOS. If let's gentoo support little endian in powerpc,
2015-07-10 20:55:29	Leno	it's will let's these distros based on gentoo embrace the little endian, or gentoo eco-system.
2015-07-10 20:55:29	Leno	And I've confirmed that there is no little endian stage3 files for powerpc currently. So the question is:
2015-07-10 20:55:30	Leno	Is there anyone have tried porting gentoo in ppc64le before ? If not, Why NOT let's gentoo support little endian

2015-07-10 21:07:19	+iamben	it's "not safe for export" or "patent encumbered" or something that makes it turn off ECDSA for binary redistrubution
2015-07-10 21:07:25	aminal	however, i've tried this work around and it hasn't gotten me any further
2015-07-10 21:08:00	+iamben	aminal: does "emerge -pvO openssl" show bindist in red or blue or other?
2015-07-10 21:08:14	aminal	hmm, ok i do see bindinst in my portage make.conf
2015-07-10 21:08:38	+iamben	yeah, it's on by default, turn it off if you don't need to be able to legally redistribute binaries to 3rd parties
2015-07-10 21:08:46	aminal	it shows it in red
2015-07-10 21:08:56	guza	iamben: do u ever use zfs on gentoo ?
2015-07-10 21:09:01	+iamben	guza: nope
2015-07-10 21:09:06	aminal	ok, good to know. is that just a flag for building purely free software or?
2015-07-10 21:09:16	aminal	never ran into this issue yet after a few years now
2015-07-10 21:09:34	+iamben	aminal: it's to disable any kind of feature which would make your binaries non-redistributable
2015-07-10 21:09:49	aminal	gotcha. ok cool
2015-07-10 21:09:59	+iamben	another example is on firefox, it disables the official logo/branding, since mozilla's trademark restrictions say you cannot distribute a custom build under the official branding
2015-07-10 21:10:09	atrigent	does anybody have any idea why the "seccomp" USE flag was added to bind-tools? as far as I can tell, only named itself (the BIND name server) can use seccomp
2015-07-10 21:10:20	guza	i have raid of 150TB, and i afraid to use xfs. I was have terrible experiance with it.
2015-07-10 21:10:21	+iamben	but it's open/free licensed, either way
2015-07-10 21:11:42	rbrooks	this is wierd it is making a bunch of extra iputils files in /package.use...  why doesnt it just pull those in as dependancy?
2015-07-10 21:12:17	+iamben	rbrooks: portage doesnt' edit its own configs w/o your consent
2015-07-10 21:12:55	+iamben	i think you're basically asking for it to auto-override what's already explicitly set by your profile & make.conf

2015-07-10 21:14:44	+iamben	rbrooks: the iputils config was created as part of the stage3 generation, it gets reused by autounmask because no other files exist in that package.use dir yet
2015-07-10 21:15:02	aminal	iamben: i got that rebuilt and my other tools can compile now. thanks for the explanations!

2015-07-11 16:15:22	username234	atrigent: You should reconsider your workflow.  --oneshot shouldn't be used that often.

2015-07-11 16:16:26	username234	atrigent: the whole point of portage (and git and yum and ...) is to install packages and track what it has installed.
2015-07-11 16:16:33	username234	or not git but apt

2015-07-11 16:18:15	wraeth	atrigent: i agree with username234 that typically you shouldn't be --oneshotting packages often enough to need a permanent solution; but like i said if you do need it, an alias would probably be safer than DEFAULT_OPTS - `alias onemerge='emerge --oneshot'` for example
2015-07-11 16:18:33	atrigent	why do you think that would be safer?
2015-07-11 16:19:42	wraeth	atrigent: because that way emerge itself isn't being set to always oneshot packages, but it still provides you the mechanism to not have to constantly add -1 to your command.

2015-07-11 16:21:23	atrigent	obviously I'm not using oneshot when I want portage to automatically update something - I do have to use it when I want to, for example, force a rebuild of a specific package

2015-07-11 16:23:49	wraeth	in most cases portage should be able to work out what needs to be rebuilt when it needs it to be rebuilt. in cases where you're installing stuff to check out, i do that from time to time and don't find the extra '-1' a bother (or having to periodically prune my world file - it helps clear out other cruft as well).

2015-07-13 09:07:40	zerobaud	Hey folks, I installed gentoo (5th time or so in this setup). However while booting (my framebuffer shows pengiuns) it says /etc/init.d/rcs not found, and greatest stack depth reached...
2015-07-13 09:07:58	zerobaud	then it continues to print can't open /dev/tty? not such file or directory (where ? is a number)
2015-07-13 09:09:42	zerobaud	I use a initramfs, and I copyed (cp -a) tty and console in the /dev dir in the initramfs
2015-07-13 09:09:42	zerobaud	I never had problems like this, Manually copying the other tty devices gets rid of the error message, but the booting process just halts
2015-07-13 09:09:43	zerobaud	pressing any key then results in cant open /bin/sh no such file or directory, or a ctrl+alt+del will say /bin/reboot not found no such file or......

2015-07-13 09:10:12	AStorm	what the heck are you doing?
2015-07-13 09:10:20	AStorm	rcs is in openrc
2015-07-13 09:10:22	zerobaud	I can upload my initramfs and kernel config
2015-07-13 09:10:28	AStorm	no, that's not useful
2015-07-13 09:10:44	FelixFire619	ok guys
2015-07-13 09:10:46	zerobaud	AStorm: I didnt remember any option of explicitly enabling rcs or whatever
2015-07-13 09:10:47	FelixFire619	im pissed at my pc
2015-07-13 09:10:49	AStorm	use dracut or genkernel to generate initramfs since you apparently don't know what you're doing
2015-07-13 09:10:50	FelixFire619	so i have a new goal!
2015-07-13 09:11:10	zerobaud	AStorm: as stated before this is my 6th time installing a setup like this, I never had any problems
2015-07-13 09:11:28	AStorm	but you seem to have broken the init system
2015-07-13 09:11:28	zerobaud	+ I would use dracut, but my setup requires a custom initramfs
2015-07-13 09:11:30	FelixFire619	Im going to figure out how to attach my entire hard drive all partions exept the partions i need for linux to a VBOX machine then were going to compile linux for my Actual laptop on the virtual box
2015-07-13 09:11:38	FelixFire619	then im going ot reboot and my pc will work in gentoo
2015-07-13 09:11:40	AStorm	dracut and genkernel can be customized
2015-07-13 09:11:45	AStorm	both have modules
2015-07-13 09:12:15	AStorm	(that said, no idea what kind of custom you need that's not already in them)
2015-07-13 09:12:22	zerobaud	I have a very specific procedure to mount my luks volume (detached header, and a password from "read' that gets appended to a file on the usb)
2015-07-13 09:12:42	AStorm	mhm, so you'd need a modified luks module, 100% doable
2015-07-13 09:13:18	AStorm	regardless, your initramfs is outdated
2015-07-13 09:13:34	zerobaud	that could be true, I have been doing this for 2 years this way...

2015-07-13 10:23:37	deathlire	this is not a gentoo question..but is an iPhone question..seems your phone may have some issues with the router..

2015-07-13 10:26:23	deathlire	do a little speed test to dev/null ssh'ed into your VPN..
2015-07-13 10:27:20	hejux	deathlire: rsync -aP remote:/dev/null . ?
2015-07-13 10:27:23	deathlire	the iPhone handles differently when its wifi..than when it is connected to 4g LTE though..a big difference in tech

2015-07-13 10:31:23	hejux	i think it's iptables issue.

2015-07-13 10:31:33	Mittttens	cc grawity
2015-07-13 10:31:33	deathlire	well thats your problem.. goto #iptables

2015-07-13 10:31:59	Mittttens	cool
2015-07-13 10:32:07	grawity	since syslinux has separate mbr.bin and gptmbr.bin
2015-07-13 10:32:10	grawity	you need the latter
2015-07-13 10:32:36	grawity	does syslinux-install_update exist on gentoo? it'll do the right thing
2015-07-13 10:32:41	deathlire	sounds like you want an efi kind of boot grawity ?

2015-07-13 10:38:44	grawity	it doesn't depend on the age of the laptop
2015-07-13 10:38:51	Mittttens	the arch wiki said that older laptops might not support it
2015-07-13 10:39:03	Mittttens	loading a gpt disk from bios that is
2015-07-13 10:39:04	grawity	the BIOS always just reads the 0th sector, where the bootcode resides, and runs it
2015-07-13 10:39:12	grawity	*some* laptops have BIOSes which are picky about the MBR's contents

I've set the cpu governor to ondemand and also enabled "acpi_cpuidle" Intel's feature and now it's even smoother.

2015-07-13 16:27:09	+grknight	Guest87785: you missed the important text above "In order to select a pure 64-bit environment, with no 32-bit applications or libraries, use a non-multilib profile: "
2015-07-13 16:27:38	Guest87785	grknight: Ah thanks, so would just desktop be best.
2015-07-13 16:27:55	+grknight	which means you can never run 32-bit after making that choice (and recompiling the toolchain)
2015-07-13 16:28:33	stanley	i'd just go for desktop

2015-07-13 16:35:54	+grknight	fast is a perceived value.  the systemd speed argument should be relegated to the trash bin as openrc can be just as fast.  they both have to wait for the kernel and disk setup which can take the bulk of the startup time

2015-07-13 18:32:38	Kelsar	SmileMZ: look at your route, if you can enable sending one
2015-07-13 18:32:58	+mrueg	iamben: this is caused by poppler-0.34.0

I found my camera listed with all the other hundreds of cameras in /lib/udev/rules.d/70-libgphoto2.rules .  I am wondering if I did something as root which made the usb ports owned by root during installation.

2015-07-13 23:02:48	p_l	bjoern3: it doesn't help that (IMO) a big chunk of FOSS community had a collective fit instead of embracing the fact that we now have a common open source base to work from, and then embraced FUD :|
2015-07-13 23:03:21	p_l	bjoern3: Now imagine that BIOSes had most of that included, except there was less openness and more hacks on top of hacks involved :|

2015-07-16 11:10:06	adnap	I wish there was something less complicated than X. Wayland seems to be more complicated or equality complicated. Why doesn't someone just write a display library with no client/server model or any networking features at all. All it should do is allow programs to create windows and handle overlap and IO
2015-07-16 11:10:45	wokko	framebuffer?

2015-07-16 11:11:20	adnap	If you just write to the framebuffer, you have to handle overlap, and IO is separate
2015-07-16 11:11:30	adnap	The library should be minimal, but not that minimal
2015-07-16 11:11:36	p_l	adnap: it was called GDI, and was source of many bugs and security issues on Windows

2015-07-16 11:11:56	p_l	also, display is plainly complicated itself
2015-07-16 11:11:59	adnap	It should take the windows it gets and write to the frame buffer while handling overlap, and also provide IO (keyboard and mouse) events
2015-07-16 11:12:07	adnap	*the window buffers
2015-07-16 11:12:27	adnap	Display is not that complicated
2015-07-16 11:12:34	adnap	There is a section of memory where the framebuffer lives
2015-07-16 11:12:42	adnap	And some VESA modes that you set up
2015-07-16 11:12:55	adnap	And then you just write pixel data to that memory

2015-07-16 11:27:45	BtbN	the screen does not read them
2015-07-16 11:27:54	adnap	I see
2015-07-16 11:28:00	p_l	RAMDAC and similar display signal generators are part of GPU
2015-07-16 11:28:13	BtbN	They don't have to be stored anywhere, unless explicitly requested
2015-07-16 11:28:17	adnap	I'm confused about something
2015-07-16 11:28:33	adnap	I have written some GL programs before, and I have always had to use a window library
2015-07-16 11:28:47	Ke	p_l: in the sense, vector computations are not much different from SSE/avx, besides being even more flexible (as they are all that's available anyway)
2015-07-16 11:28:52	BtbN	Of course, something has to create the window?
2015-07-16 11:28:52	adnap	But it sounds like the window library itself uses GL
2015-07-16 11:28:53	-->	tiguillom (~gvercoute@5.23.43.158) has joined #gentoo
2015-07-16 11:28:57	p_l	Ke: OpenGL "classic" fixed pipeline and some of its issues come from the fact that the original GL hardware had a honest FIFO into which you stuck commands executed directly by GPU
2015-07-16 11:29:00	adnap	Er
2015-07-16 11:29:03	adnap	The display library
2015-07-16 11:29:05	adnap	X11 for example
2015-07-16 11:29:11	adnap	The thing the window library uess
2015-07-16 11:29:13	adnap	*uses
2015-07-16 11:29:22	adnap	Assuming one doesn't use X11 directly
2015-07-16 11:29:25	p_l	adnap: the window library is so you can organize with other stuff where your image will end up on, input, window messages etc.
2015-07-16 11:29:52	adnap	Wait...
2015-07-16 11:30:00	adnap	Is X11 like one big GL program
2015-07-16 11:30:02	p_l	for example, on X11 with GLX+DRI, you can properly inform necessary components that your window will have contents rendered directly by GPU
2015-07-16 11:30:04	adnap	I'm confused
2015-07-16 11:30:09	p_l	adnap: with glamor driver, yes, X11 will use GL

2015-07-16 11:30:30	adnap	So, if X11 can use GL to draw to the screen
2015-07-16 11:30:35	p_l	but most importantly, Xserver does the necessary arbitrage and synchronization between applications
2015-07-16 11:30:45	admin__	kurly, I have an ERP running on a VM. Suddenly this error shows up. Re-emerging php with 'calendar' does not do anything....
2015-07-16 11:30:45	adnap	...then a GL program can draw to the screen by itself without creating a window
2015-07-16 11:30:46	adnap	I guess
2015-07-16 11:30:46	BtbN	You don't have to care how X draws its stuff. It gives you a context via GLX, and you draw into that.
2015-07-16 11:30:53	BtbN	How it works internaly doesn't matter.
2015-07-16 11:30:58	p_l	so that the GPU knows that GL context X is writing to window Y which has position Z
2015-07-16 11:31:19	BtbN	X rarely actualy draws anything nowdays
2015-07-16 11:31:28	BtbN	it just organizes where the windows are
2015-07-16 11:31:43	p_l	Ke: GPU ISAs often contain instructions like "fetch texture" :)
2015-07-16 11:31:54	adnap	There is some concept of a display in GL that is not a window that I don't undestand
2015-07-16 11:31:57	adnap	I'm guessing
2015-07-16 11:32:03	BtbN	no, there isn't.
2015-07-16 11:32:15	BtbN	OpenGL has no concept of displays or windows at all.
2015-07-16 11:32:24	adnap	Because in all my GL programs, I have to create a window and then magically everything I draw in my GL context gets displayed on that window
2015-07-16 11:32:36	BtbN	OpenGL has an active context, that's it.
2015-07-16 11:32:42	adnap	So...
2015-07-16 11:32:45	BtbN	It draws to the conext that is currently active in the calling thread.
2015-07-16 11:33:02	BtbN	What that context is is entirely opaque to the application.

2015-07-16 11:33:52	prock	is there a way to get the masked package  media-sound/pasystray without having to downgrade pulseaudio, as least that what i htink its trying to do
2015-07-16 11:33:55	adnap	So, a program creates a GL context and then sends a bunch of triangles to GL, which eventually get converted into a bunch of pixels
2015-07-16 11:34:35	adnap	How does the area on the screen where the pixels are displayed get defined?
2015-07-16 11:34:45	Mittttens	okay so I created a LUKS partition
2015-07-16 11:34:47	p_l	adnap: and the driver in Xserver (or in windows, or else) provided the information *where* to draw the result
2015-07-16 11:34:50	Mittttens	with LVM inside
2015-07-16 11:34:52	adnap	Normally, I would specify a resolution with the window library
2015-07-16 11:34:59	Mittttens	I can open the partition
2015-07-16 11:35:18	Mittttens	but how to I get the physical volume / volume groups to be there
2015-07-16 11:35:20	adnap	And the window library would also handle the positioning of the window on the screen
2015-07-16 11:35:37	Mittttens	like how do I get /dev/mapper/group-rootvol to be there so I can mount it
2015-07-16 11:35:38	kurly	prock: what exactly is failing?  do you need a line 'media-sound/pasystray' in your /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords (or package.keywords if you are old school)
2015-07-16 11:35:48	BtbN	GLX or EGL gives you you a context, that context is assiged to an X drawable, that drawable coroponds to a window.
2015-07-16 11:35:48	adnap	p_l: So, there is some GL call you can make that tells GL where to write pixels to?
2015-07-16 11:35:58	adnap	p_l: And the window lib does this?
2015-07-16 11:36:00	BtbN	No, OpenGL has no concept of that at all.
2015-07-16 11:36:14	p_l	adnap: not OpenGL function, but each GPU has stuff like that (except Voodoo xD)
2015-07-16 11:36:23	adnap	Ohhh, the GPI
2015-07-16 11:36:25	adnap	*GPU
2015-07-16 11:36:28	BtbN	what?
2015-07-16 11:36:30	adnap	Because I was like
2015-07-16 11:36:37	p_l	it's implemented in the driver that does GLX/WGL/EGL apis
2015-07-16 11:36:37	adnap	GL has no concept of a screen
2015-07-16 11:36:39	adnap	Or resolution

2015-07-16 12:14:56	adnap	Yeah, so for the programs *users* want to run over a network, they must instead obtain a program derived from that program which has been broken into a client which talks to Y and a server which sends data to the client
2015-07-16 12:15:09	njsg	why?
2015-07-16 12:15:22	JCaesar	njsg: I am not on my system because I like it. I think its currently the best viable option.
2015-07-16 12:15:26	rx80	adnap: there are whole universities and schools, that run computer labs full of thin clients
2015-07-16 12:15:27	njsg	why go through all that efford instead of using X or ssh?
2015-07-16 12:15:47	wraeth	the program simply runs on the remote computer and says to X "show this". it's up to X itself to show it wherever it's supposed to be show, the program itself doesn't care
2015-07-16 12:15:50	adnap	Because in the most common case, users don't want to run programs over a network, and so by making that assumption, Y is much simpler than X

2015-07-16 12:16:52	njsg	also, this is UNIX. at some point, it started having a lot of networking, it is normal to have networking features in X, I'd say
2015-07-16 12:16:56	njsg	and it's a good thing
2015-07-16 12:17:05	adnap	I think it should be removed
2015-07-16 12:17:07	njsg	adnap: think of it! if X has networking, you get that for free as soon as you use X!

2015-07-17 09:25:02	gabora	Hi, my gentoo starts programs really slow for the first time after each  boot.
2015-07-17 09:25:14	gabora	Every program. make menuconfig and browsers too.
2015-07-17 09:25:23	gabora	But once they have been started before, its quick.
2015-07-17 09:25:29	gabora	Why would that be?
2015-07-17 09:25:37	kurly	filesystem caching
2015-07-17 09:25:56	gabora	But is this normal even if I used caching?
2015-07-17 09:26:07	kurly	at least that's why it's quick after they've been starting before
2015-07-17 09:26:20	kurly	caching wouldn't slow down the initial load
2015-07-17 09:26:24	+xiaomiao	gabora: reading from disk is slow, reading again you can read from memory which is faster
2015-07-17 09:26:32	gabora	Aha.
2015-07-17 09:26:55	gabora	Maybe im missing a kernel config option or something, but how can i make sure whats the problem?

2015-07-17 09:28:11	+xiaomiao	it's not a problem
2015-07-17 09:28:22	+xiaomiao	you're noticing that harddisks are slower than RAM, which is quite normal
2015-07-17 09:28:30	kurly	memory is many times faster than hard disk
2015-07-17 09:28:35	kurly	orders of magnitude faster

2015-07-17 09:32:43	gabora	I think its a problem, because in windows i can start a browser much faster than a "make menuconfig" in command line in gentoo.
2015-07-17 09:33:01	gabora	And thats why i think its not a hardware feature, but a config.

2015-07-17 09:34:02	+xiaomiao	you could try emulating it, for example with e4rat
2015-07-17 09:35:03	gabora	Well, to be honest, every program starts faster in windows than make menuconfig.

2015-07-17 09:36:22	+xiaomiao	can you run make menuconfig in windows?

2015-07-17 09:38:03	+xiaomiao	gabora: compare firefox with firefox
2015-07-17 09:38:11	+xiaomiao	and even then you might not get comparable results
2015-07-17 09:39:38	gabora	xiaomiao: Hm. I just taught of something. Windows in on a different drive, maybe thats quicker anyway because of that.
2015-07-17 09:39:50	gabora	But anyway, i want to make sure that its not a configuration issue.

2015-07-22 21:26:54	ameisyq	some tips for getting openbox up and running perhaps? i tried with a minimal .xinitrc containing just "exec openbox-session"...and the xserver mysteriously segfaults without saying anything very comprehensible in the logs

2015-07-22 21:47:42	+iamben	stanley: you are mistaken.  if you were missing i965, it's because you explicitly set i915.

2015-07-22 23:08:30	haasn	password, so that was no go. But then I remember that you get dropped into a shell if it fails loading the root partition, so I just gave it a wrong ‘root=’ parameter and watched it fail loading /, then mounted it myself from within the recovery shell and managed to use ‘echo’ to reset the file to a working  state :p

2015-07-25 19:32:53	giuseppe_	when for example i use a chat service... like say whats'app (i don't use it) but is well known and will fit ok for the example... i send a message (i.e. packets to a what'sapp server) and he stores my message on its server... but how does he send my message to the receiver ? doesn't he have to open a port on the network on which the receiver is ? to send the message on a certain port?
2015-07-25 19:33:12	k117	Hello. Where can i find list of all CPU_FLAGS_X86?
2015-07-25 19:34:35	username234	giuseppe_: I'm not familiar with that app, but when it comes to chat / messaging systems all users log into a server and that server keeps track of which connection (socket) is each user.  So when User A sends a message to user B, the server receives the message from A's socket and then send it out on B's socket

2015-07-25 19:35:20	username234	giuseppe_: the server won't open a connection to 'B' because 'B' already did that when it logged into the server.

2015-07-25 19:46:39	tyler_	username234, in fact, it was just the naive implementation that made it so bad. I didn't even know about lazytime until I realized I wanted to enable atime and though sure someone thought to cache them by now. Why it wasn't done back in 1.0 or 2.0 is beyond me.

My bluetooth device 0a5c:216a was correctly detected, could power on but not discoverable or discover anything. To solve the issue, i had to find the right hcd file (BCM43142A0-0a5c-216a.hcd) from http://forum.ubuntu.ru/index.php?topic=255502.0 and uncompress it to /lib/firmware/brcm/.

2015-07-27 16:37:11	+ryao	I have some DVDs with bad sectors (likely copy protection) and I want to make some backups. Standard archiving tools (dd and k9copy) are failing due to the bad sectors. I have yet to try ddrescue. Are there any tools specialized in handling archival of DVDs that I could use?

2015-07-27 16:37:46	+ryao	Playing them is fine. It is just that the guy who formatted them ended up putting bad sectors, presumably between tracks where a DVD player would not read.
2015-07-27 16:37:57	+ryao	Or if a DVD player did read them, it would probably just ignore them.

I don't have much experience with https proxy and I know that for https proxy is needed a self signed certificate that will do wildcard (  *  ). Is there a way for me to buy a SSL certificate that will achieve this behavior? I found only wildcard certificates for subdomains (*.example.com) - Sorry if this sounds like a stupid question

2015-07-30 20:25:35	+iamben	adding ~x86 keyword is not what makes it build 64+32 libs, if that's what you mean
2015-07-30 20:25:35	genericum	iamben: Im afraid not
2015-07-30 20:25:43	+iamben	you control that via abi_x86_32
