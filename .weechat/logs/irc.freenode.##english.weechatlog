2014-03-06 19:12:21	fabioportieri	"pieno di se" is pretty straigthforward (full of himself), but sometimes it's not so easy
2014-03-06 19:12:24	MarkDavies	Well, but these are English-English dictionaries, unfortunately I don't know any good Italian dictionaries, but I'm sure that one must exist. But you may use a more pocket-like dictionary, then consult OALD.
2014-03-06 19:13:09	MarkDavies	fabioportieri: another way is just to ask people here if looking for the phrase in the dictionary has already failed.

2014-03-07 18:01:53	death|drunk	In Sweden it happens that men go bare-chested to the supermarket in summertimes. I don't know what to think of that, more than pointing out the fact that they are air-conditioned, so not really summer climate inside.
2014-03-07 18:02:13	Dementati	death|drunk: Well, you only stay in the supermarket for a short time.
2014-03-07 18:02:19	Dementati	And then you go out into the sunshine again.
2014-03-07 18:02:27	Dementati	It's a hassle to change clothes I guess.

2014-03-07 18:04:20	death|drunk	Dementati: I mean conservative as in not allowing too much room for avoidant social behaviour in general. Nudity is quite a relaxed sphere in Sweden though.
2014-03-07 18:04:20	Dementati	We're not really offended, we're just annoyed that this is what our tax money is paying for.

2014-03-09 14:24:12	TakWah	I once accidentially invented a music instrument too, but it wasn't very practical. But if one was to sample the sounds, it could sound decent. May sound stupid to you, but if you take a roll of scotch tape and pull it of in with the right angle and force and speed it makes cool sounds.
2014-03-09 14:24:24	TakWah	It just depletes after a while, that's the problem with practical use.

2014-03-09 14:24:59	Elench	 You should sample it and make tracker music
2014-03-09 14:25:05	TakWah	And yes, exposure sure helps
2014-03-09 14:25:45	Jorgebio	Elench: thanks for be sensitive with beginners
2014-03-09 14:25:51	TakWah	ya, i tried for years to do something decent with a tracker, but it never turned out. Composing isn't just for everyone, but I could sample the sound itself. That is rather technical ;)

2014-03-29 09:59:34	flukiluke	Only thing I can maybe suggest if delete the "For instance, " at the start of the second sentence.
2014-03-29 09:59:44	flukiluke	That's really a personal opinion though.
2014-03-29 10:00:05	flukiluke	Other than that, a nice piece of writing.

2014-03-29 10:01:38	optikal-	Thanks. the thing about "for instance," though, is that it's a tramsitional phrase. it relates the previous to the current. For instance could be... "As an example, or..."In simpler terms." \

2014-03-29 10:03:02	optikal-	just like "As an illustration" is a transitional phrase

2014-03-29 10:03:49	flukiluke	I think it might be because you follow it with "According to astronomers," which also acts as a transitional phrase.
2014-03-29 10:04:45	flukiluke	And really, the sentence doesn't directly provide an exmaple of what was stated in the previous one.

2014-03-29 10:21:34	flukiluke	Well, that comma before UFOs should be a full stop. Typo.

2014-05-09 16:07:47	Lateefah	For example, if you baked someone a pie, and they complained about the shape of the whipped cream on top, that would be nitpkcing.

2014-05-09 16:08:24	Lateefah	Or if you went to see a movie with a friend, and you asked him what he thought of it, and he complained of the choice of font in the title screen.

2014-05-11 10:57:19	Tonitrus	You'd need at least 'growing'.  Also, why are we talking about this?
2014-05-11 10:58:40	Lateefah	I think you're right. Admire doesn't work that way. I wonder why it doesn't though, Tonitrus .
2014-05-11 10:59:00	Lateefah	Because admire, in its origin, is a sort of verb of seeing.
2014-05-11 10:59:34	Lateefah	So, "I saw the cat eat the fish."
2014-05-11 10:59:37	Lateefah	That's fine.

2014-05-11 11:00:44	Tonitrus	But it doesn't have to do with what the word means.
2014-05-11 11:00:51	Lateefah	Bare infinitive, rather.
2014-05-11 11:01:02	furrykef	I think it has to be a verb of perception: see, hear, feel, etc.
2014-05-11 11:01:09	furrykef	"admire" doesn't count as perception

2014-05-11 11:02:42	furrykef	It needs to be a direct sense. "observe" doesn't specify which sense is used; it's only implied by context
2014-05-11 11:02:53	furrykef	Hmmm
2014-05-11 11:02:56	dkaslk	it is taken from French

2014-05-11 11:04:00	Tonitrus	The inclusion of or omission of 'to' seems to be entirely arbitrary and based off two different infinitive patterns in OE.

2014-05-11 11:04:19	Tonitrus	Whether 'to' is used is predictable in OE, but doesn't seem to be very related to how we use it today.

2014-05-11 11:04:47	Tonitrus	You'd say "I saw him go." in OE, as in NE, and "I ordered him to go" the same.
2014-05-11 11:05:07	Tonitrus	But in OE you used the inflected infinitive with sort of... instructions of purpose or whatever

2014-05-11 20:06:51	moonlily	apb_: I think it's just an established common usage :-/
2014-05-11 20:07:52	Twey	moonlily: Usually, ‘affect’ is a verb (to change somehow) and ‘effect’ is a noun (the change something has)
2014-05-11 20:07:54	moonlily	 As verbs, they are used differently. Affect most commonly means ‘produce an effect on, influence’: Effect means ‘bring about’

2014-05-11 20:08:40	Twey	moonlily: But there are also a few noun senses of ‘affect’, like emotion or something that is put deliberately on display, and ‘effect’, like… right, that
2014-05-11 20:08:44	moonlily	Twey: It's just that "effect" also can be used as a verb, and I think that that's what the question is – Why we use "affect" and not "effect" for verb
2014-05-11 20:08:52	Twey	s/and ‘effect’/and verb senses of ‘effect’/
2014-05-11 20:08:55	moonlily	Twey: Right, but the example is above

2014-05-11 20:09:16	Twey	apb_: But it's probably meant to be ‘affecting’
2014-05-11 20:10:16	moonlily	Right
2014-05-11 20:10:26	moonlily	apb_: "usage: Affect and effect are both verbs and nouns, but only effect is common as a noun"

2014-05-11 20:13:02	apb_	words ending in ing are verbs
2014-05-11 20:13:08	apb_	yes?
2014-05-11 20:13:15	Twey	apb_: As a rule of thumb, ‘effect’ is a noun and ‘affect’ a verb.  It's not strictly true, but those are by far the most common usages.
2014-05-11 20:13:24	Twey	apb_: They… can be.  >.<
2014-05-11 20:13:24	moonlily	apb_: Basically, the answer is that it could be either in that context :P But we think it's probably more fitting to understand it as "affect"
2014-05-11 20:14:16	Twey	apb_: There are two syntactically identical but grammatically distinct forms that end in -ing.  There's the gerund, as in ‘I like swimming’, and the present participle, such as ‘I am swimming’

2014-05-11 22:07:17	minous	The construction makes no sense.
2014-05-11 22:07:40	minous	For example, "it's better compared to X than compared to Y" makes sense.

2014-05-11 22:09:56	yellowfish	do I need the while?
2014-05-11 22:10:50	minous	"Even while during" is nonsensical.
