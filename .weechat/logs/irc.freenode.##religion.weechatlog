2014-03-07 18:30:54	demophobia	cythrawll, another point to note is that even if other weeping statues have been debunked, what matters is whether *this one* has been. (I'm not conceding that other weeping statues have been, by the way, because I've never heard of any others.)
2014-03-07 18:31:43	demophobia	(However, the existence of other fraudulent attempts is still consistent with the Christian message, since we expect the devil to imitate-yet-pervert.)
2014-03-07 18:33:37	cythrawll	the fraudulent attempts were made by man, not by supernatural forces
2014-03-07 18:34:06	cythrawll	also If there was such a thing as the devil, I don't see how it's ruled out that the devil did the akita.
2014-03-07 18:34:45	Dry_Lips	Just a little thing to keep in mind, guys... Statues and such is a Catholic thing... Protestants don't approve of religious statues, icons, etc
2014-03-07 18:35:18	cythrawll	also I am afraid it hasn't been debunked because it seems like it was never properly studied.  because the time it happened 101 times, it was in the presence of people so emotionally involved they would not have attemptd to objectively study the phenomenon.  It has been stated that mas hysteria is a possibility for Akita.
2014-03-07 18:35:44	cythrawll	As the phenomenon hasn't been really observed since
2014-03-07 18:36:10	cythrawll	and you showed me the letter, it kind of shows how unobjective the peopel were who were involved.
2014-03-07 18:36:27	cythrawll	They rejected all natural explanations without any justification to do so.
2014-03-07 18:39:19	Dry_Lips	I'm with you on the fact that weeping statues of Mary is no valid proof of the truth in Christianity, cythrawll
2014-03-07 18:40:02	cythrawll	I would also like to point out similar miracles have happened quite a bit in Buddhism that have yet to be fully debunked as well?
2014-03-07 18:40:15	cythrawll	so we should all be buddhists now.
2014-03-07 18:40:18	cythrawll	this is confusing
2014-03-07 18:40:28	cythrawll	so many religions with so many similar claims of truth
2014-03-07 18:40:33	cythrawll	how do you choose? 
2014-03-07 18:40:34	cythrawll	:p
2014-03-07 18:41:43	Dry_Lips	Well, think of it in this way...
2014-03-07 18:42:00	Dry_Lips	If there is a God...
2014-03-07 18:43:05	Dry_Lips	Would he be dependent upon weeping statutes in order to demonstrate that he is a living entity?
2014-03-07 18:43:20	Dry_Lips	A statue is a dead thing
2014-03-07 18:44:08	Dry_Lips	How can a dead object be the representation of a living God?
2014-03-07 18:47:29	Dry_Lips	As far as Christianity is concerned:
2014-03-07 18:48:39	Dry_Lips	In the first few verses of Hebrew it is stated that Jesus was the true image of God
2014-03-07 18:49:45	Dry_Lips	So we cannot rely on dead objects to teach us about the divine
2014-03-07 18:50:42	Dry_Lips	Only Jesus can be said to be an image of God
2014-03-07 18:55:59	KindOne	misstranslations ..

2014-03-09 22:02:31	demophobia	cythrawll, "none so blind as them that will not see" appears to apply to you: You keep leveling accusations against Akita, e.g. "they were too emotionally invested to study the matter objectively", that are refuted by actually studying the case. "I don't see how it was ruled out by the devil" is likewise addressed by the bishop's pastoral letter, indicating that you did not understand it as well as you think you have.
2014-03-09 22:03:06	cythrawll	demophobia, it was addressed, but it was bad reasoning.
2014-03-09 22:03:35	cythrawll	it came down to, "It wasn't the devil because some lady that got healed said it wasn't"
2014-03-09 22:03:51	cythrawll	which i don't see, if the devil existed, couldn't have been a ruse by the devil
2014-03-09 22:03:58	cythrawll	I mean the letter is full of bad reasoning
2014-03-09 22:04:15	cythrawll	I'm not blind here, it's just so obvious to me, and it's something you're unwilling to see
2014-03-09 22:04:36	demophobia	That's not what the bishop said at all.
2014-03-09 22:05:11	demophobia	To say that, when the bishop said nothing like that, suggests to me that either you didn't read it, or you are mentally ill.
2014-03-09 22:06:20	cythrawll	I read it.
2014-03-09 22:06:26	cythrawll	i'm just paraphrasing it.
2014-03-09 22:06:45	cythrawll	you're almost afraid I think to even paraphrase the letter itself
2014-03-09 22:06:50	cythrawll	I read it
2014-03-09 22:07:01	cythrawll	nothing in it was convincing, it was just full of shockingly bad reasoning.
2014-03-09 22:07:12	cythrawll	If you think otherwise, defend yourself
2014-03-09 22:07:25	cythrawll	otherwise your accusations are pointless.
2014-03-09 22:07:39	demophobia	Well, perhaps it wasn't the same letter that I read, but I thought it was. Dude, there's nothing to "defend against", because you're making straw man arguments. There's nothing to say except, "You have not responded to anything I said."
2014-03-09 22:08:13	cythrawll	demophobia, no i've given clear problems with the letter's reasoning.
2014-03-09 22:08:34	cythrawll	and your only response was that I didn't read it.
2014-03-09 22:10:01	cythrawll	I mean the problem with the whole thing, is the reasoning was clearly taken place inside a catholic world view. which honestly is fine, however it did a incredibly poor job of studying the issue objectively.
2014-03-09 22:11:20	cythrawll	and due to the limited amount of time this thing supposidely happened.  There was no objective study except for body fluids that were studied after the fact.  Which honestly could have been faked, There doesn't seem to be any documentation on how the samples were collected to make sure they weren't tampered with.
2014-03-09 22:11:40	cythrawll	the fact that the samples all came from different humans would suggest that
2014-03-09 22:12:04	cythrawll	and like I said, all natural explanations were dismissed without cause.
2014-03-09 22:13:46	cythrawll	it did also nothing to actually consider the visions were genuine or not.
2014-03-09 22:37:15	demophobia	It wasn't studied "after the fact" -- It was studied "during" and before conclusions were made.
2014-03-09 22:37:18	demophobia	again, straw man fallacy
2014-03-09 22:37:43	demophobia	your point about "to determine whether the visions were genuine" is incoherent -- what does "genuine" mean? etc
