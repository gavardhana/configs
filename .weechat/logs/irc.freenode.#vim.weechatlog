2014-03-02 19:20:10	paradigm	transliteration is weird.  It shouldn't be pronounced with an English "th" at the end, but there isn't a good way I know to get an "h" after a "t".
2014-03-02 19:20:40	paradigm	my Hebrew is super rusty, I really should find people to practice with more
2014-03-02 19:20:47	rindolf	paradigm: well, in modern Hebrew we pronounce an unstressed ת as "t" instead of "th".

2014-03-05 20:27:30	vimgor	Vim is an advanced text editor that seeks to provide the power of the de-facto Unix editor 'Vi', with a more complete feature set. It's useful whether you're already using vi or using a different editor. Vim IS NOT an editor designed to hold its users' hands. It is a tool, the use of which must be learned.

2014-03-05 20:42:08	dhruvasagar	foist_: your goal is to decide which version to keep in the current file, the target (before merge) or the upstream (merged version), sometimes it can involve keeping both removing some lines, but again that is subjective depending on the situation

This will disable the latter half of the file. Retest now to see if your problem persists. If so then the problem is inside the still active half. Otherwise the problem is in the disabled half. Repeat with binary divisions as necessary. bisectly

2014-03-07 20:20:46	LeoNerd	"Do one thing well" is the principle of UNIX. Consider that carefully

2014-03-07 20:21:45	foist_	I'm currently using 'map <leader>dt :set makeprg=python\ manage.py\ test\|:call MakeGreen()<CR>' to run my tests. I'd like to combine it with vim-dispatch to make it less intrusive. Anyone know how I would do that?

2014-03-07 20:21:55	nonconvergent	I'm stepping through some old perl code looking for function calls.  They specified all the functions with & fortunately.  Is there a way to highlight/step through them all without hitting standalone & or && operators?

2014-03-07 20:23:05	tommcdo	nonconvergent: If that's the case, a pattern like  \<&\w  might do.

2014-03-07 20:23:27	nonconvergent	tommcdo: In this case yes. It's a deprecated way of calling functions.  You can leave off the & now.
