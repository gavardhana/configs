2014-05-14 19:55:48	wushin	O yeah
2014-05-14 19:56:51	wushin	They also don't get "enclosing" things in quotes
2014-05-14 19:57:10	wushin	You kids get off my compiler
2014-05-14 19:57:36	wushin	but meh, it's interesting watching code mature
2014-05-14 19:57:38	DuClare	If kids actually got on a compiler, I could be happy
2014-05-14 19:57:43	DuClare	But all I see them do is twiddle their phones
2014-05-14 19:58:18	wushin	Tablets == Toys
2014-05-14 19:58:24	wushin	Phones == Toys
2014-05-14 19:58:30	<--	FirePowi (~powifire@chc71-1-82-242-186-104.fbx.proxad.net) has left #themanaworld ("Quitte")
2014-05-14 19:58:34	DuClare	More or less.
2014-05-14 19:58:55	wushin	Way less control as well
2014-05-14 19:58:56	DuClare	As always, you can propose a serious use case for them.  And then you see what people do with them.  Toys indeed.
2014-05-14 19:59:21	wushin	Well yeah, but we still sell more dildos then iphones every year
2014-05-14 19:59:29	wushin	but the news never reports on that
2014-05-14 19:59:37	DuClare	I'd actually like to have a tablet for note taking & browsing and such for when I'm on the go (laptops are quite clunky).  But my impression is that the software is all gimmicks and toys and you can't get useful shit done on them..
2014-05-14 20:00:10	DuClare	I don't want a toy that says no no, you have to throw me away and buy a new one after 18 months because I'm too old now
2014-05-14 20:00:14	wushin	Meh, I want to hire a human being to be my "tablet/phone"
2014-05-14 20:00:43	wushin	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squire
2014-05-14 20:00:50	wushin	or Page/Runner/etc.
2014-05-14 20:01:12	wushin	wishes he could afford to install a series of semaphores around his hood
2014-05-14 20:02:30	t3st3r	[19:58:20] <wushin> Tablets == Toys <- worse, they turn "humans" into "consumers". That's what suxx.
2014-05-14 20:03:39	wushin	t3st3r on that note about consumer whores: http://youtu.be/r_TVAnd4qbs
2014-05-14 20:04:03	wushin	If you've not seen Don Hertzfeldt's Rejected I suggest your waste 10 minutes
2014-05-14 20:04:41	wushin	I wish commercials were like that.
